{"prompt": "what's the difference between mass and weight", "orig_response": "Mass and weight are related but distinct concepts in physics. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, typically expressed in kilograms or grams, and it remains constant regardless of the object's location in the universe. Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted on an object due to gravity and is dependent on both the mass of the object and the gravitational acceleration acting on it, usually measured in newtons or pounds. This means that while an object's mass remains the same whether it is on Earth, the Moon, or in space, its weight will vary depending on the strength of the gravitational field in that location.", "response": "Mass and weight are related **bu**t distinct concepts in physics.
