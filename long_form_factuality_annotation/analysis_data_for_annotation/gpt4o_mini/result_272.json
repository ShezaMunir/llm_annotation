{"prompt": "Please explain to me how deep learning works. Pretend I am a 7 year-old.", "orig_response": "Okay! Imagine you have a big box of colorful building blocks, and you want to build a really cool castle. Deep learning is like teaching a computer to build its own castle using lots of layers of blocks. Each layer helps the computer understand different things, just like how you might start with a strong base and then add walls, towers, and decorations. The computer looks at many pictures or examples, and with each layer, it learns to recognize shapes, colors, and patterns, just like you learn to build better castles the more you practice. So, deep learning helps computers learn from lots of information, layer by layer, until they can do things like recognize your face in a photo or understand what you say!", "response": "**O**ka**y**! **Imagine **you have a big box of **colorfu**l building blocks**, an**d you want to build a **really cool castle**.
