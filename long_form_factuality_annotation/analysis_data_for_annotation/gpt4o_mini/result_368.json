{"prompt": "Explain to me the difference between over-the-counter and prescription medicine", "orig_response": "Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine and prescription medicine differ primarily in their availability and regulation. OTC medications can be purchased without a doctor's prescription and are generally considered safe and effective for treating minor ailments, such as headaches or colds, when used as directed. They undergo a rigorous approval process by regulatory agencies, but their safety profile allows for public access. In contrast, prescription medicines require a healthcare provider's authorization due to their potential for side effects, interactions, or misuse, and are typically used to treat more serious conditions or diseases. The prescription process ensures that a qualified professional evaluates the patient's specific health needs before recommending a treatment, thereby providing a higher level of oversight and safety.", "response": "Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine and prescription medicine differ** primaril**y in their availability and regulation.
