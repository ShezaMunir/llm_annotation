{"prompt": "Please list step by step how to make a hard boiled egg.", "orig_response": "To make a hard-boiled egg, start by placing the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and adding enough cold water to cover them by about an inch. Next, bring the water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, cover the saucepan with a lid, remove it from the heat, and let the eggs sit for about 9 to 12 minutes, depending on your desired level of doneness (9 minutes for slightly soft centers, 12 for fully firm). After the time is up, carefully transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water or run them under cold water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Once cooled, gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell, then peel them under running water for easier removal. Your hard-boiled eggs are now ready to be enjoyed!", "response": "To make a hard-boiled egg, start by placing **the egg**s in a single layer in a saucepan and adding **enough cold wate**r to cover them by about an inch. **Next, bring **the water to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.
