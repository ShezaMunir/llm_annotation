This surgical technique, which utilizes a segment of the sigmoid colon to create a neovagina, is often favored for its ability to provide a more natural appearance and function compared to other methods. Complications can occur, but they are typically manageable, and many patients report positive outcomes in terms of sexual function and overall quality of life.
