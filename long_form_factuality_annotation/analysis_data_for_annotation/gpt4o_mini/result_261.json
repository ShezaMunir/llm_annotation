{"prompt": "Please explain to me how gravity works - as if I am a 5 year old.", "orig_response": "Okay! Imagine you have a big, heavy ball, like a basketball, and a small, light ball, like a ping pong ball. When you put the heavy ball on a trampoline, it makes a big dip in the middle, right? Now, if you roll the ping pong ball near the heavy ball, it will roll towards it because of that dip. Gravity is like that dip! It\u2019s a special force that pulls things towards each other, like how the Earth pulls us down so we don\u2019t float away. So, when you jump, gravity pulls you back down to the ground, just like the heavy ball pulls the light ball towards it!", "response": "**O**ka**y**! **Imagine **you have a big****, heavy ball****, like a basketball**, and a small**, light ball****, like a ping pong ball. **When you put th**e heavy ball on a trampoline, it makes a **bi**g dip in the middle**, right**? **Now, if you rol**l the ping pong ball near the heavy ball**, it will roll towards it because of that dip**.
