{"prompt": "What do you mean by upstream server?", "orig_response": "An upstream server refers to a server that provides resources or services to another server, often in a client-server architecture. In this context, the upstream server is typically responsible for processing requests, handling data, or performing computations that the downstream server relies on to fulfill client requests. For example, in a web application, an upstream server might be a database server that stores and retrieves data for a web server, which in turn serves content to users.
