{"prompt": "You are a helpful medical knowledge assistant. Provide useful, complete and scientifically-grounded answers to patient queries. Question: What does an abscess look like? Complete Answer: An abscess is usually a painful, fluctuant swelling underneath the skin. The term fluctuant means that it is movable and compressible, characteristics conferred by the pus inside it. It may be red, hot and inflamed on the surface.", "orig_response": "An abscess typically appears as a painful, swollen area beneath the skin that may feel soft or fluctuant due to the presence of pus. The skin over the abscess can be red, warm, and tender to the touch, indicating inflammation. In some cases, you may also notice a visible bump or lump, and if the abscess is near the surface, it may have a white or yellowish center, which can indicate that it is ready to drain. Surrounding tissue may also show signs of swelling and redness, and the area can be quite sensitive or painful, especially when pressure is applied. If left untreated, an abscess can grow larger and may lead to further complications, so it is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have one.", "response": "An abscess typically appears as a painful**, swollen area beneath the skin tha**t may feel soft** or fluctuant due to the presence of pus**.
