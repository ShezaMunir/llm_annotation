{"prompt": "in fortnite what is the different between blue health and white health\n\n", "orig_response": "In Fortnite, the main difference between blue health and white health is the level of damage a player has taken. Blue health represents a player's full health, which is typically 100 health points. As a player takes damage from enemies, environmental hazards, or other sources, their health bar turns blue and gradually depletes. When a player's health is depleted to a certain point, usually around 50-75 health points, their health bar turns white. This indicates that the player is low on health and is more vulnerable to further damage. If a player's health bar remains white for an extended period, they will eventually die and respawn at a designated location.", "response": "**In Fortnite, the mai**n difference between blue health and white health is the level of damage a player has taken.
