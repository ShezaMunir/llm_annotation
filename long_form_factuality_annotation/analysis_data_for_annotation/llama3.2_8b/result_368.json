{"prompt": "Explain to me the difference between over-the-counter and prescription medicine", "orig_response": "The primary difference between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicine lies in the level of regulation and the requirement for a medical professional's approval. Over-the-counter medicine is available for purchase without a prescription from a healthcare provider, and it is typically used to treat minor, self-limiting conditions such as headaches, colds, or allergies. These medications are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are required to have clear labeling and instructions for use. In contrast, prescription medicine requires a doctor's or other licensed healthcare provider's approval before it can be dispensed. Prescription medications are often used to treat more serious or complex conditions, such as chronic diseases, and may have more severe side effects or interactions with other medications. As a result, prescription medications are subject to stricter regulations and are typically only available through a licensed pharmacy with a valid prescription.", "response": "The primary difference between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medicine** lies in the level of regulation an**d the requirement for a medical professional's approval.
