    "prompt": "Sorry my cat stepped on my keyboard. I was trying to ask what is the absolute maximum network speed achievable as of today?",
    "response": "As of my most recent update, the absolute maximum network speed achievable in strictly controlled laboratory environments can reach into the petabits per second (Pbps) range. For instance, researchers from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) in Japan have demonstrated transmission speeds of over 1 petabit per second using advanced fiber-optic technology with multiple cores and multiple wavelengths.\n\nHowever, the speeds achievable in commercial and real-world applications are significantly lower. Consumer-level high-speed internet services currently offer speeds up to multiple gigabits per second (Gbps). For example, 10 Gbps internet services are available in some areas, and fiber-optic networks are growing in availability and capacity.\n\nIn data centers and enterprise contexts, speeds can go higher. Technologies like 400 Gbps Ethernet and even experimental 800 Gbps Ethernet are being developed and implemented to meet the growing demand for high-speed data transfer.\n\nThe disparity between laboratory and commercial speeds is due to various factors, including cost, infrastructure, and the technological challenges of maintaining such high speeds over long distances and in real-world conditions.",
