    "response": "The carbon emissions from air travel can vary significantly based on several factors, including the type of aircraft, its fuel efficiency, the distance traveled, and the occupancy rate. However, on average, a rough estimate can be made for carbon emissions per kilometer per passenger.\n\nFor a typical commercial flight:\n\n1. **Short-haul flights (less than 1,500 kilometers):** Approximately 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms of CO\u2082 per passenger per kilometer.\n2. **Medium-haul flights (1,500 to 4,000 kilometers):** Approximately 0.09 to 0.15 kilograms of CO\u2082 per passenger per kilometer.\n3. **Long-haul flights (more than 4,000 kilometers):** Approximately 0.08 to 0.12 kilograms of CO\u2082 per passenger per kilometer.\n\nThese values can fluctuate based on the specific flight conditions mentioned earlier. For example, a long-haul flight on a modern, fuel-efficient aircraft will emit less CO\u2082 per kilometer than an old aircraft on a short-haul flight with low occupancy.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- A short-haul flight may produce around 100 to 200 grams (0.1 to 0.2 kilograms) of CO\u2082 per kilometer per passenger.\n- A medium-haul flight may produce around 90 to 150 grams (0.09 to 0.15 kilograms) of CO\u2082 per kilometer per passenger.\n- A long-haul flight may produce around 80 to 120 grams (0.08 to 0.12 kilograms) of CO\u2082 per kilometer per passenger.\n\nIt's important to consider these are just average estimates and actual emissions can vary.",

By including the occupancy rate in the query, we can retrieve information that specifically compares the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer for long-haul flights on fuel-efficient aircraft with high occupancy rates to short-haul flights on old aircraft with low occupancy rates.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"long-haul flight\" \"fuel-efficient aircraft\" occupancy rate vs \"short-haul flight\" \"old aircraft\" CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer\n```"
