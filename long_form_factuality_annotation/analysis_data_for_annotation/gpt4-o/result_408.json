    "prompt": "How do I defeat Guardians in Breath of the Wild?",
    "response": "Defeating Guardians in \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\" can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can use depending on the type of Guardian and the equipment you have. Here are some effective methods:\n\n### 1. **Use Guardian Weapons:**\nGuardian weapons, such as the Guardian Sword, Guardian Axe, and the Ancient Battle Axe, are highly effective against Guardians. You can obtain these weapons by defeating other Guardians or purchasing them from the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab.\n\n### 2. **Use Ancient Arrows:**\nAncient Arrows can kill Guardians in one shot if you hit their eye. You can obtain Ancient Arrows from Akkala Ancient Tech Lab or by completing certain quests. They are expensive, but worth it if you have a tough battle ahead.\n\n### 3. **Reflect the Beam with a Shield:**\nIf you have a good shield and precise timing, you can parry the Guardian's laser beam back at it. Perform a perfect parry by pressing the 'A' button just before the beam hits you. This will reflect the beam back, dealing significant damage.\n\n### 4. **Shoot the Eye:**\nUsing regular arrows, you can shoot the Guardian in its eye to temporarily stun it, giving you a window to deal damage. Repeatedly shoot the eye to keep the Guardian stunned.\n\n### 5. **Use Stasis+:**\nIf you have upgraded to Stasis+, you can freeze the Guardian in place for a short amount of time. This will give you an opportunity to attack its legs or eye without worrying about it moving or attacking you.\n\n### 6. **Destroy the Legs:**\nFor Guardian Stalkers (the spider-like ones), you can target and destroy their legs. This will immobilize them and make it easier to either defeat them or escape. Use strong melee weapons or bomb arrows for this tactic.\n\n### 7. **Use Bombs:**\nRemote Bombs can be used against small Guardian Scouts found in Shrines. They can be used to chip away at their health, though it's a slower method and requires dodging and patience.\n\n### 8. **High Ground Advantage:**\nIf you can gain some elevation while fighting a Guardian, you can target its eye more easily and evade its attacks. Use nearby structures or terrain to your advantage.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Armor Up:** Wear armor with high defense or specific buffs against Guardians, like the Ancient Armor set.\n- **Cooking:** Prepare meals and elixirs that boost your attack power or provide resistance to damage.\n- **Save:** Always save your game before engaging a Guardian, in case things go wrong and you need to retry.\n\nCombining these strategies will give you a better chance of successfully defeating Guardians and progressing through the game. Good luck!",

From the RESPONSE, we can see that the context is about defeating Guardians in \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\" Thus, the vague reference \"a tough battle ahead\" should be replaced with \"defeating a tough Guardian.\"\n\n```\nAncient Arrows are worth it if you're preparing to defeat a tough Guardian.\n```\n\nReasoning: The original UNIT is part of a larger strategy guide for defeating Guardians in the game. The phrase \"a tough battle ahead\" is vague because it doesn't specify what kind of battle or what kind of enemy. By replacing it with \"defeating a tough Guardian,\" we make the UNIT more specific and clear, while still keeping it concise and focused on the original message."
