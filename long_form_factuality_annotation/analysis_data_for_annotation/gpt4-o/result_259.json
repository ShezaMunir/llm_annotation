The type of object that is being logged (Event).\n- **apiVersion**: The API version used (`audit.k8s.io/v1`).\n- **level**: Level of logging (`Metadata` in these examples).\n- **auditID**: A unique identifier for the audit event.\n- **stage**: Indicates the stage of the request (e.g., `ResponseComplete`).\n- **requestURI**: The URI of the request which includes the executed command and query parameters.\n- **verb**: The action taken (e.g., `create`).\n- **user**: Information about the user executing the command.\n- **sourceIPs**: The IP addresses from which the request originated.\n- **userAgent**: The client used to make the request.\n- **objectRef**: Information about the target resource.\n- **responseStatus**: The status of the request (e.g., `200` for success, `403` for forbidden).\n- **requestReceivedTimestamp**: Timestamp when the request was received.\n- **stageTimestamp**: Timestamp when the event stage completed.\n- **annotations**: Additional context about the authorization decision.\n\nThese examples provide an idea of how `kubectl exec` commands appear in Kubernetes audit logs, which can be essential for security monitoring and compliance.",
