You can do this by either dropping the extra columns in the DataFrame or selecting only the necessary columns before performing the insertion.\n\nHere is how you can drop the extra columns:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n# Sample DataFrame with extra columns\ndata = {\n    'id': [1, 2, 3],\n    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n    'age': [25, 30, 35],  # Assume this column does not exist in SQL Server table\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# The SQL Server table has only 'id' and 'name' columns\ncolumns_needed = ['id', 'name']\ndf_filtered = df[columns_needed]\n\n# Create an engine to connect to the SQL Server\nconnection_string = 'mssql+pyodbc://username:password@server/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server'\nengine = create_engine(connection_string)\n\n# Insert the DataFrame into the SQL Server table\ndf_filtered.to_sql('your_table_name', con=engine, if_exists='append', index=False)\n```\n\nOr if you prefer to select only the required columns:\n\n```python\ncolumns_needed = ['id', 'name']\ndf_filtered = df[columns_needed]\n```\n\nIn both cases, make sure that `df_filtered` has exactly the same columns as your target SQL Server table.
