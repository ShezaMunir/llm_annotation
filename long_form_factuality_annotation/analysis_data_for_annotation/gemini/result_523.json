    "prompt": "How to use discord package in Python3 ",
    "response": "Here's a breakdown of how to use the `discord.py` package to build your own Discord bots in Python 3, along with clear examples and explanations:\n\n**1. Installation**\n\nBefore you begin, you'll need to install the `discord.py` library:\n\n```bash\npip install discord.py\n```\n\n**2. Basic Bot Structure**\n\nLet's start with the fundamental code for a simple Discord bot:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nimport os\n\n# Replace with your bot's token\nDISCORD_TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')\n\n\nintents = discord.Intents.default()  # Define the events your bot needs to listen for\nintents.message_content = True  # To process message content\n\nclient = discord.Client(intents=intents)\n\n@client.event  \nasync def on_ready():\n    \"\"\"Prints a message to the console when the bot is connected and ready.\"\"\"\n    print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    \"\"\"Responds to messages sent in the server.\"\"\"\n    if message.author == client.user:  # Prevents the bot from responding to its own messages\n        return\n\n    if message.content.startswith('!hello'):\n        await message.channel.send('Hello there!') \n\nclient.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Imports:** We import the necessary `discord` library and the `os` module to access environment variables.\n* **Intents:** Intents specify the types of events your bot should receive from Discord. The `discord.Intents.default()` line sets up intents for common events like messages. To process message content, you need to specifically enable the `message_content` intent. \n* **Client Object:** The `discord.Client` object is your connection to Discord. It handles events and interactions.\n* **Events (`@client.event`)**\n   * **`on_ready()`:**  This function is called when your bot successfully connects to Discord.\n   * **`on_message(message)`:**  This function is called every time a message is sent in a server your bot is part of. \n* **Commands:**\n   * The `if message.content.startswith('!hello')` line checks if a message starts with the prefix `!hello`. If it does, the bot responds with \"Hello there!\".\n* **Running the Bot:** The `client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)` line starts the bot, using your unique bot token (explained below).\n\n**3. Getting Your Bot Token**\n\n1. **Discord Developer Portal:** Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. **Create an Application:** Click \"New Application\" and give it a name.\n3. **Create a Bot:** Navigate to the \"Bot\" section within your application and click \"Add Bot\".\n4. **Copy Token:** Carefully copy the token provided. **Treat this token as a secret; never share it publicly.**\n\n**4. Adding the Bot to Your Server**\n\n1. **OAuth2 URL:**  In the Developer Portal, go to your application's \"OAuth2\" section.\n2. **Scopes:** Select the \"bot\" scope.\n3. **Permissions:** Choose the necessary permissions for your bot (e.g., \"Send Messages\", \"Read Message History\").\n4. **Generate URL:** Copy the generated URL.\n5. **Visit URL:**  Paste the URL into your browser and follow the prompts to add the bot to your server.\n\n**5. Running Your Bot**\n\n1. **Save your code:** Save your code as a `.py` file (e.g., `my_bot.py`).\n2. **Set your token:**\n   * **Option 1 (Environment Variable):**\n     ```bash\n     export DISCORD_TOKEN='your_bot_token_here'\n     ```\n   * **Option 2 (Directly in code):** Replace `'your_bot_token_here'` in your code with your actual token.\n3. **Run:**  Execute your script from the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   python my_bot.py \n   ```\n\n**Key Points & Best Practices**\n\n* **Asynchronous Programming:** The `async` and `await` keywords indicate that `discord.py` uses asynchronous programming. This is essential for handling events efficiently.\n* **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling using `try...except` blocks to prevent your bot from crashing unexpectedly.\n* **Documentation:** Explore the extensive `discord.py` documentation for advanced features, events, commands, and more: [https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/index.html](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/index.html)\n* **Respect Rate Limits:** Discord has rate limits to prevent abuse. Be mindful of these limits when designing your bot's behavior.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help with a more specific bot feature, such as creating commands, embedding messages, or working with voice channels! \n",

By adding \"anti-abuse measures\" to the search terms, we may uncover new information on specific techniques used by Discord to prevent abuse. The use of the \"site:\" operator ensures that we only retrieve results from Discord's official blog, increasing the relevance and credibility of the results.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(\"Discord rate limits\" OR \"Discord API rate limits\") AND (\"abuse prevention\" OR \"security measures\" OR \"mitigation strategies\" OR \"anti-abuse measures\") site:discord.com/blog\n```"
