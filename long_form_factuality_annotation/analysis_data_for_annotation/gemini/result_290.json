Global Cache:**\n\n   - Poetry maintains a global cache of downloaded packages to avoid unnecessary downloads.\n   - The location of this cache is system-dependent. You can find it by running `poetry config cache-dir`.\n   - On Linux and macOS, it's usually in `~/.cache/pypoetry`.\n   - On Windows, it's typically in `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\pypoetry\\Cache`.\n\n**2. Project Virtual Environment:**\n\n   - When you install packages using Poetry within a project (using `poetry add` or `poetry install`), they are installed within a virtual environment specific to that project.\n   - By default, Poetry creates this virtual environment within the project directory itself, in a folder named `.venv`.\n   - You can customize this location using the `virtualenvs.in-project` setting in your `poetry.toml` file or globally in the Poetry configuration.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n- The global cache stores downloaded packages to reuse them across projects.\n- The project virtual environment stores packages specific to that project, ensuring isolation and dependency management.\n",
