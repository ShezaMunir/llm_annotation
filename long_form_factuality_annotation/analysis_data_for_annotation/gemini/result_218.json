To further verify the accuracy of the STATEMENT, this query expands the search to include \"AEST\" (the abbreviation for Australian Eastern Standard Time) and combines it with the city-based identifiers. By excluding the words \"compromise\" and \"acceptable\" (which were present in the previous results), we can focus on finding more direct references to the TZ Database Identifiers.\n\n**Final Query:**\n```\n(\"AEST\" OR \"Australia/Brisbane\" OR \"Australia/Sydney\") site:iana.org tz database -\"compromise\" -\"acceptable\"\n```"

This should help retrieve more specific and relevant information about the identifiers for Australian Eastern Standard Time.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(\"AEST\" OR \"Australia/Brisbane\" OR \"Australia/Sydney\") site:iana.org tz database filetype:txt -\"compromise\" -\"acceptable\"\n```"
