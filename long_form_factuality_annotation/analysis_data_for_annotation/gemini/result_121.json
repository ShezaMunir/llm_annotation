This should help us uncover more relevant and authoritative sources that can verify the statement's accuracy.\n\n**Rationale for new keywords:**\n\n* `\"social enterprise\"` and `\"social venture\"` are more specific terms that might yield more targeted results compared to `\"social entrepreneurship\"`.\n* `\"turning kindness into a business\"` is a rephrased version of the original statement, which might help us find more relevant results.\n* `\"profitable altruism\"` is retained from previous rounds to maintain consistency and explore its relevance in the UK academic context."
