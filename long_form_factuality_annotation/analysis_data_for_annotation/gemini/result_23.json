Only creatures inherently possess a type, like humanoid, fey, or undead.\n* **Animated Objects follow specific rules:** The *animate objects* spell outlines how the animated objects function, including their statistics, movement, and actions. It does not assign them a creature type.\n\n**Therefore, spells or abilities that affect creatures specifically will not affect objects animated by the *animate objects* spell.**\n\nFor example:\n\n* **Hold Monster:** Would not work on an animated statue because it is not a creature.\n* **Speak with Animals:**  Would not work on an animated chair because it is not an animal, nor a creature. \n\n**Important Note:** The DM can always make exceptions or rule differently based on the specific circumstances of the situation and their interpretation of the rules. \n",

The objects come to life at the caster's command, and medium targets count as 2 objects, while large targets count as 4 objects.\n4. Animated objects are immune to certain conditions, such as poison, psychic, blinded, charmed, and others.\n5.

This implies that an animated statue, which is a type of Animated Object, is indeed a creature. However, the STATEMENT claims that the Hold Monster spell would not work on an animated statue because it is not a creature.

The KNOWLEDGE points establish that a \"creature\" is a broader category that includes all animals, but not all creatures are animals.\n2. The definition of a creature is any living thing, whereas animals are a specific group of creations.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that creatures can be creations of gods, fey, fiends, or humanoids, which implies that the term \"creature\" encompasses a wide range of beings.\n4. The D&D 5E context is mentioned, but no specific definition of \"creature\" or \"animal\" is provided.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, an animated chair would not be considered an animal, as it does not belong to the regular animal group. However, the KNOWLEDGE points suggest that a creature can be any living thing, which could potentially include an animated chair. The STATEMENT claims that Speak with Animals would not work on an animated chair because it is not an animal, but it is unclear whether it would be considered a creature.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT can be restated as: \"Speak with Animals would not work on an animated chair because it is not an animal, but it is unclear whether it would be considered a creature.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the evidence, I conclude that the STATEMENT is [Unverifiable].
