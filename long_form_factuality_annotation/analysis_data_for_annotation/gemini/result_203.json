The third KNOWLEDGE point mentions that Engineering Information, Inc. was an independent company from 1934 until 1998, when it was purchased by Elsevier.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, it appears that Ei was acquired by Elsevier in 1998 and was no longer an independent company. There is no evidence to suggest that Ei still exists as a brand under Elsevier.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT remains the same: Engineering Information, Inc.
