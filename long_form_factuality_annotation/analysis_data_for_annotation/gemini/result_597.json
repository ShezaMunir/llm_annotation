    "prompt": "What is an \"enforcer\" role in cricket?",
    "response": "The term \"enforcer\" in cricket doesn't refer to a formally designated role like a batsman or a bowler. Instead, it's a more informal term used to describe a specific type of batsman. \n\nHere's what an \"enforcer\" usually refers to:\n\n**Characteristics of an Enforcer:**\n\n* **Aggressive Batsman:** Their primary job is to score runs quickly and put pressure on the opposition bowlers.\n* **Middle-Order Batsman:** They usually bat after the top-order has built a foundation or when the team needs to accelerate the scoring rate.\n* **Power Hitting:**  They are known for their ability to hit big sixes and boundaries consistently.\n* **Risk-Taker:** Enforcers are willing to take risks to maintain a high strike rate, even if it means potentially getting out.\n\n**Purpose of an Enforcer:**\n\n* **Shift Momentum:** They can quickly change the course of a match by scoring quick runs and putting the opposition on the back foot.\n* **Break Partnerships:** When bowlers are restricting the flow of runs, enforcers can break the rhythm and force them to rethink their strategy.\n* **Finish Innings Strongly:**  They are crucial in the final overs of an innings to maximize the total.\n\n**Examples of Famous Enforcers:**\n\n* **Viv Richards (West Indies)**\n* **Andrew Symonds (Australia)**\n* **Lance Klusener (South Africa)**\n* **Hardik Pandya (India)**\n* **Andre Russell (West Indies)**\n\n**In essence, an \"enforcer\" in cricket is a hard-hitting batsman who can change the game with their aggressive approach.** They may not always be the most technically sound batsmen, but their ability to score quickly makes them a valuable asset to any team. \n",

The second KNOWLEDGE point discusses the characteristics of cricket batting, mentioning \"controlled aggression\" and balancing risks and rewards.
