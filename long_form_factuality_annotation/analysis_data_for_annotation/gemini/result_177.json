By adding the `AND` operator and keywords like \"definition\", \"type\", or \"classification\", we can retrieve information that specifically addresses the categorization of \"text\" in the HTML spec.\n\n**Query Explanation:**\nThis query builds upon previous rounds by refining the search to focus on the HTML specification (w3.org) and seeking definitions or classifications that clarify the relationship between \"text\" and \"text input\".
