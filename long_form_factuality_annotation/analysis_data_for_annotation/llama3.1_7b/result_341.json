Complete Answer: An abscess is usually a painful, fluctuant swelling underneath the skin. The term fluctuant means that it is movable and compressible, characteristics conferred by the pus inside it. It may be red, hot and inflamed on the surface.", "orig_response": "An abscess typically appears as a painful, fluctuant swelling underneath the skin, which means it is movable and compressible due to the presence of pus inside. The skin overlying the abscess may be red, hot, and inflamed, indicating an active infection. The abscess itself may be tender to the touch and may have a visible border or a distinct edge, which can be firm or soft depending on the stage of the infection. In some cases, the abscess may rupture, leading to the release of pus through a small opening in the skin, which can provide temporary relief but may also lead to further complications if not properly treated.", "response": "An abscess typically **appears as a painful, fluctuan**t swelling underneath the skin**, which means it is movable an**d compressible** due to the presence o**f pus inside.
