{"prompt": "Please explain to me how gravity works - as if I am a 5 year old.", "orig_response": "Gravity is like a big hug from the Earth. You know how when you give your favorite teddy bear a big hug, you want to keep it close to you? The Earth is like a big teddy bear, and it wants to keep everything close to it too. That's why things don't float off into space when you drop them. The Earth's hug pulls everything towards it, so your toys, your ball, and even you stay on the ground. It's like the Earth is saying, \"I love you, stay close to me!\" And that's why we don't float away when we're standing on the ground.", "response": "Gravity is **lik**e a big hug from the Earth. **You know how **when you give your favorite teddy bear a big hug, you want to keep it close to you?
