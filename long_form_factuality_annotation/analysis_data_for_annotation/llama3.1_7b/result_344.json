{"prompt": "How much better is GPT-4 than GPT-3.5?", "orig_response": "GPT-4 is a significant improvement over GPT-3.5 in various aspects. One of the primary differences is its increased scale, with 320 billion parameters compared to GPT-3.5's 175 billion parameters. This increased scale allows GPT-4 to better understand and generate more coherent, context-specific responses. Additionally, GPT-4 has been fine-tuned on a larger and more diverse dataset, which enables it to better handle nuanced and complex topics. In terms of performance, GPT-4 has demonstrated improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations, particularly in tasks that require a deeper understanding of context and semantics. However, it's essential to note that the exact magnitude of improvement can vary depending on the specific task or application, and more research is needed to fully understand the differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.", "response": "**One of the primary differences is its increased scale, wit**h 320 billion parameters compared to GPT-3.5****'s 175 billion parameters. **Th**is increased scale
