{"prompt": "Is there a version of stable diffusion that can be run on CPU and can be made in python code?", "orig_response": "Yes, there are versions of Stable Diffusion that can be run on CPU and can be implemented in Python code. One such version is the \"Diffusers\" library, which is a Python library for Stable Diffusion and other diffusion models. It provides a CPU-compatible version of Stable Diffusion, allowing users to run the model on their CPU without the need for a GPU. The library also includes a simple API for generating images from text prompts, making it easy to integrate into Python projects.
