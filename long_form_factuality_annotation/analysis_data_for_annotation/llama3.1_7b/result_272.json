{"prompt": "Please explain to me how deep learning works. Pretend I am a 7 year-old.", "orig_response": "Imagine you have a super smart friend who can look at lots of pictures and learn what they are. This friend is like a computer program called a \"neural network.\" It's made up of many tiny \"brain cells\" that work together to figure things out. When you show the neural network a picture, it looks at the colors and shapes and says, \"Oh, I think I see a cat!\" But how does it know it's a cat? Well, the neural network looks at lots of pictures of cats and dogs and other things, and it starts to learn what makes a cat look like a cat. It's like it's learning a secret code that says, \"If you see whiskers and pointy ears, it's probably a cat!\" The more pictures it sees, the better it gets at recognizing cats and other things. And that's basically how deep learning works - it's like a super smart friend who gets better and better at recognizing things as it looks at more and more pictures.", "response": "**Imagine **you have a super smart** friend wh**o can look at lots of pictures** an**d learn what the**y are**.
