{"prompt": "In the context of machine learning, give a comprehensive  explanation of how does back propergation work?", "orig_response": "Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used to train artificial neural networks. It's a supervised learning technique that works by minimizing the error between the network's predictions and the actual output. The process begins with the forward pass, where the network receives an input, propagates it through the layers, and produces an output. The error between the predicted output and the actual output is then calculated using a loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy. The backpropagation algorithm then kicks in, where the error is propagated backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases of each layer to minimize the loss. This is done by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias, which is then used to update the parameters using an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The process is repeated for each training example, and the network's parameters are updated after each iteration. The backpropagation algorithm continues until the network converges to a solution, or a stopping criterion is reached, such as a maximum number of iterations or a desired level of accuracy. By iteratively adjusting the network's parameters to minimize the error, backpropagation enables the network to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance on the training data.", "response": "**It**'s a supervised learning technique** tha**t works by minimizing the error between the network's predictions and the actual output.
