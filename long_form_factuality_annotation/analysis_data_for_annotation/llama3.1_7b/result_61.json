{"prompt": "Why does IPL have strategic timeouts?", "orig_response": "The Indian Premier League (IPL) has strategic timeouts to manage the game's tempo and provide a break for the players. These timeouts, also known as \"strategic timeouts\" or \"time-outs,\" allow the teams to pause the game for a short period, usually 3 minutes, to discuss strategies, make tactical decisions, and regroup. This break helps the teams to assess the game's situation, make adjustments to their bowling or batting approach, and plan their next move. The timeouts also give the players a chance to rest and recharge, which can be beneficial, especially in high-intensity matches. Additionally, the timeouts provide an opportunity for the teams to use their video analysts and coaches to review the game footage and provide valuable insights to the players. Overall, the strategic timeouts in IPL are designed to enhance the game's competitiveness, strategy, and player well-being.", "response": "The Indian Premier League (IPL) has strategic timeouts** t**o
