Typically, ear infections in babies are accompanied by symptoms such as a high fever, usually above 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), irritability, fussiness, or crying, especially when lying down or during feeding. You may also notice that your baby is pulling or tugging at their ear, or exhibiting a loss of appetite. Additionally, ear infections can cause a yellow or green discharge from the ear, although this is not always present. In some cases, babies may also exhibit a change in their sleep patterns, such as waking up frequently at night or having difficulty falling asleep.
