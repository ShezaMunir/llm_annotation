{"prompt": "Please list step by step how to make a hard boiled egg.", "orig_response": "To make a hard-boiled egg, follow these steps: First, place one or more eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. Next, add enough cold water to the pan to cover the eggs by about an inch. Place the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer and let the eggs cook for 10-12 minutes for large eggs. After the cooking time has elapsed, immediately transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let the eggs sit in the ice water for 5-10 minutes to cool down. Finally, crack the eggs gently and peel off the shells, and your hard-boiled eggs are ready to eat or use in recipes.", "response": "To make a hard-boiled egg, **follow these steps: First**, place one or more eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. **Next, add enough cold wate**r to the pan to cover the eggs by about an inch.
