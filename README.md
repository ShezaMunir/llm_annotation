# llm_annotation
Human annotation for unit extraction quality (completeness) and correctness (right label).  

## Annotation process:

1. install flask ```pip install flask```
2. run ```python app.py``` to start the server
3. go to the localhost URL (most likely: http://127.0.0.1:5000)
4. enter your name in the sign up page 
5. click radio buttons for annotations
6. use the 'go to entry' box at the bottom to jump to particular entry
7. remember your username, the csv file will be stored under a folder of that name in your local pc. 
8. you can track entries in the csv file to take a pause and come back to annotating later.
