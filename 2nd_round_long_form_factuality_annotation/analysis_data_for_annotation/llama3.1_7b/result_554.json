{"prompt": "When is the best time to plant potatoes in the northern hemisphere", "orig_response": "In the northern hemisphere, the best time to plant potatoes depends on your location and climate. Generally, it's recommended to plant potatoes in early spring, about 2-4 weeks before the last frost date in your area. This allows the plants to mature before the heat of summer. In regions with a long growing season, you can also plant potatoes in late summer or early fall, about 8 weeks before the first frost date, for a second crop. In areas with a short growing season, it's best to plant potatoes in early spring, as soon as the soil can be worked. It's essential to choose a variety that is suitable for your region and climate, and to plant them at the correct depth and spacing to ensure optimal growth and yield.", "response": "**In the northern hemisphere, **the best time to plant potatoes depends on your location and climate. **Generally, it**'s recommended to plant potatoes in early spring**, about 2-4 weeks before the last frost date in your area**. **Thi**s allows the plants to mature before the heat of summer.
