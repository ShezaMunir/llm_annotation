If you're looking for the fastest option, flying is typically the best choice, with direct flights available from Oakland International Airport (OAK) to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), taking around 5-6 hours. Alternatively, if you prefer a more scenic route and have time to spare, you could consider a road trip, which would allow you to explore various cities and landscapes along the way, though it would take several days.
