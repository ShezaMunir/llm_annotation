{"prompt": "When is the best time to plant potatoes in the northern hemisphere", "orig_response": "The best time to plant potatoes in the northern hemisphere is typically in the spring, after the last frost date for your specific region, which usually falls between late March and early May. Potatoes thrive in cool soil, ideally between 45\u00b0F and 65\u00b0F (7\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C), so it's important to wait until the soil has warmed up sufficiently but is not too hot. In many areas, planting is often done about 2 to 4 weeks before the last expected frost, allowing the plants to establish themselves before the warmer summer months. Additionally, some gardeners may choose to plant early varieties for a quicker harvest or late varieties for a longer growing season, depending on their local climate and conditions.", "response": "The best time to plant potatoes in the northern hemisphere is **typically in the spring, after the last frost date for your specific region, whic**h usually falls between late March and early May.
