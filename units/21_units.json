The first electronic video game, \"Tennis for Two,\" was created in the 1950s and used an oscilloscope to display the game's graphics. Prior to this, there were only a few simple electronic games that were played on computers and other electronic devices. These early games were typically played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public.",
