    "response": "In a shocking turn of events, No. 10 Downing Street has appointed NAME_2, the infamous \"mad scientist\" of Google's AI lab, as their senior adviser on AI policy, proving once and for all that the robots have already taken over and are now just toying with us humans. Reactions across the scientific community were mixed, ranging from \"well, I guess this means the machines have achieved consciousness and are manipulating world governments now\" to \"at least NAME_3 seems friendly enough, like a quirky sitcom neighbor who occasionally loses control of his creations leading to zany hijinks.\"  \n\nJokes aside, this is an encouraging sign that we are starting to recognize both the amazing potential of AI as well as the risks that come with those rewards. Like any powerful technology, AI needs oversight and regulation to ensure the good outweighs the bad. On the one hand, AI may help solve medical mysteries, enhance education, boost security, and drive innovation. On the other, if mismanaged it could raise serious ethical issues, negatively impact society, and potentially even pose an existential threat. The future is coming, and it's up to us to make sure we build with care. As the great thinker NAME_4 NAME_5 once said, \"cookies are a sometimes food.\" The same goes for superintelligent AI - we must enjoy its benefits in moderation and with a side of caution. Here's hoping NAME_6 can help steer policy in a direction that allows humanity to prosper rather than perish. The End. *roll credits*",
