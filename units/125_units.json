    "response": "To wrap text in tkinter in Python, you can use the `tkinter.Message` widget. This widget allows you to display a message in a dialog box. Here is an example of how to use it:\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import tkMessageBox\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\n\ndef show_message():\n    tkMessageBox.showinfo(\"Message\", \"Hello, World!\")\n\nbutton = tk.Button(root, text=\"Show Message\", command=show_message)\nbutton.pack()\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\nThis code creates a `Tk` object as the main window for the tkinter application. It then creates a `Button` widget with the text \"Show Message\" and a command that displays an info message with the text \"Hello, World!\" using the `tkMessageBox.showinfo` method. Finally, it packs the button and starts the mainloop to display the window.\n\nYou can customize the message by passing a string argument to the `showinfo` method. For example, `tkMessageBox.showinfo(title, message, icon=tk.WARNING)` will display a warning message with the specified title and message.\n\nYou can also use the `showwarning`, `showerror`, and `showerror` methods to display different types of messages.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",
