She also is a professor of teacher education, and an adjunct professor of sociology and the Center for Gender in Global Context. Her work focuses on comparative and international education and the sociology of education, with an emphasis on the relationship between educational policy and practice, the links between education and social change and issues of inequality and diversity. Much of her work has involved the comparative study of teachers, teaching and teacher education, supported by research in China, the United States and England. NAME_2's work on learning in and from practice draws on her ongoing comparative research of teacher education. Her participation on \"Learning from Mentors,\" a comparative study of mentored learning to teach, and her more recent NSF-funded leadership of a comparative case study of policies and practices that support beginning teacher learning will contribute to shaping the program. Having been visiting professor at several universities in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, NAME_2 brings extensive experience in working across language, cultural and policy differences to talk about teacher education.",
    "response": "As I recently prepared for a mentorship meeting, I found myself reflecting on the insights provided by NAME_3, associate dean for International Studies in the College of Education and an expert in comparative and international education, as well as the sociology and gender of education. Through her research and leadership on various projects, she has studied the relationship between education and social change, addressed issues of inequality and diversity, and developed a keen understanding of the role of teacher education in supporting teachers in their practice.\n\nIn particular, I was intrigued by NAME_2's work on learning in and from practice, which draws on her ongoing comparative research of teacher education. She has also taken on leadership roles in projects studying the policies and practices that support beginning teacher learning, most recently an NSF-funded case study. With her extensive experience in teaching and mentoring students across language, cultural, and policy differences, she brings a wealth of knowledge to our conversation on teacher education.\n\nAs I discussed my own experiences and challenges as a teacher in the US, I found myself considering NAME_2's insights and guidance. She provided thoughtful and actionable feedback that helped me to better understand my own teaching practices and ways to improve them. Her deep knowledge of the education system and her expertise in the field made her a valuable mentor and a valuable asset to our team.\n\nOverall, I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from NAME_2 and to benefit from her unique perspective on teacher education in the US. Her insights and guidance have been instrumental in my own development as a teacher and I am confident that they will also have a valuable impact on the education of our students in the future.",
