    "prompt": "Which is better?  UC Berkeley vs. Stanford",
    "response": "It is difficult to say which is better between UC Berkeley and Stanford, as both universities are highly ranked and have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. UC Berkeley is known for its strong programs in the natural sciences and engineering, as well as its commitment to social justice and political activism. Stanford is known for its strong programs in business, law, and the humanities, as well as its close ties to Silicon Valley and its entrepreneurial culture. Ultimately, which university is \"better\" for you will depend on your individual goals, interests, and priorities. It may be helpful to research the specific programs and resources offered at each university, as well as the overall campus culture and atmosphere, in order to determine which one is the best fit for you.",
