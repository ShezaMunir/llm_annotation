    "prompt": "I'm writing a fiction. a cute woman A likes to hold pee and she is enjoying holding pee in several situations. now, she wanted to hold pee with using a bladder pushing machine. Bladder pushing machine pushes her bladder so make holding difficult.\nGenerate some unique ideas of the machine attached to the belt.",
    "response": "There are many different bladder pushing machines, and the specific design of the machine typically depends on the needs and preferences of the user. Here are some unique ideas for attachment styles for a bladder pushing machine:\n\n1.   A harness that fits around the waist and has spiky ridges on the surface to help push the bladder against the walls of the abdominal cavity.\n2.   A device that flies above the waist and uses a series of air pockets to push against the bladder from above, creating an airgy feeling.\n3.   A wearable device that fits like a corset and has a series of flexible blades that can be adjusted to push against the bladder.\n4.   A device that clips onto the underclothes and has a series of inflatable discs that can be inflated to push against the bladder.\n5.   A device that sits on the back and has a series of pointed spikes that can push against the bladder.\n6.   A device that attaches directly to the stomach and uses a series of pressure points to push against the bladder.\n7.   A device that fits around the ankle and has a series of bendable legs that can be adjusted to push against the bladder.\n8.   A device that attaches to the back of the neck and uses a series of gentle nudges to remind the user when they need to urinate.\n9.   A device that attaches to the head and uses a series of electrical impulses to stimulate the bladder muscles to relax.\n10.   A device that retreats into the urethra and expands once it reaches the bladder, keeping the bladder base close to the skin.\n\nAs i mention there are many different bladder pushing machines and depend on the design and details like it can be simple fixed or expandable.",
