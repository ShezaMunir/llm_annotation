    "response": "To debug a Linux kernel with QEMU on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install QEMU:\n```csharp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qemu\n```\n2. Create a virtual machine configuration file for the Linux kernel you want to debug. You can use the following example as a starting point:\n```php\n<virtualbox>\n  <source>\n    <file format=\"vmdk\" />\n    <drive letter=\"h\" />\n  </source>\n  <memory startup=\"128\" />\n  <cpus number=\"1\" />\n  <disk space=\"1024\" />\n</virtualbox>\n```\n3. Start the virtual machine and install the Linux kernel you want to debug:\n```css\nqemu-system-linux -M virt -M video=hd1600x900 -net nic,model=netusb -net user,id=1000 -cd /path/to/linux/kernel.img -drive if=none,id=h,file=/path/to/linux/kernel.vmdk -drive if=none,id=h,file=/path/to/linux/initrd.img -smp 1\n```\n4. Once the virtual machine is running, you can use gdb to debug the Linux kernel. You will need to know the location of the Linux kernel and initrd images in the virtual machine, as well as the virtual machine's IP address and console socket.\n```php\ngdb -ex Onig BB_REGION_ALL -ex Onig BB_FILE_ALL -ex Onig BOLD_ALL -ex Onig UNDERSCORE_ALL -ex Onig SCOPE_ALL -ex Onig COMMENT_SINGLE_LINE -ex Onig COMMENT_MULTI_LINE -ex Onig BB_VERBOSE_MASK -ex Onig ONIG_SYNTAX_KINDOF -ex Onig VENDOR_CARAT_MASK -ex Onig VENDOR_CARAT_IF_INSIDE_BRACKETS -ex Onig PLAIN_CARAT_MASK -ex Onig PLAIN_CARAT_IF_INSIDE_BRACK",
