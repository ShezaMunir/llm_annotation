The main steps are:\n\n1. Pick a pivot element (we pick the last element)\n2. Partition the array by moving all elements less than the pivot to the left of it and greater than the pivot to the right of it. The pivot ends up in the correct sorted position. \n3. Recursively quicksort the left and right partitions.\n\nThe base case is when low >= high, in which case the array is sorted.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",
