    "prompt": "How can i create a NAME_1 in flutter",
    "response": "In Flutter, you can create a `NAME_1` widget using the `NAME_1` class. Here is an example of how to create a `NAME_1` widget:\n```less\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n  return SliverList(\n    delegate: SliverChildListDelegate(\n      children: <Widget>[\n        Container(color: Colors.red),\n        Container(color: Colors.green),\n        Container(color: Colors.blue),\n      ],\n    ),\n  );\n}\n```\nThis creates a `SliverList` widget with a `SliverChildListDelegate` that manages the children of the `NAME_1`. The `SliverList` takes a delegate, which is an instance of `SliverChildListDelegate`, that is used to manage the children of the `NAME_1`. The `SliverChildListDelegate` has a `children` property, which is a list of widgets that are inserted into the `NAME_1`.\n\nYou can also use the `SliverMultiBoxAdapter` to reuse the same layout for multiple slivers.\n```java\nclass MySliverMultiBoxAdapter extends SliverMultiBoxAdapter {\n  @override\n  final List<Widget> children = <Widget>[\n    Container(color: Colors.red),\n    Container(color: Colors.green),\n    Container(color: Colors.blue),\n  ];\n\n  @override\n  Directionality get directionality => Directionality.down;\n\n  @override\n  bool isMirrored => true;\n\n  @override\n  BoxConstraints get constraintsForChild(int index) {\n    return BoxConstraints(\n      width: double.infinity,\n      height: 200,\n    );\n  }\n\n  @override\n  void performLayout(BoxConstraints constraints) {\n    // Perform layout\n  }\n}\n```\nThis creates a multi-box adapter that you can pass to the `NAME_1` widget.",
