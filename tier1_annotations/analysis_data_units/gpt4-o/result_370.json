    "response": "The nearest star to Earth, other than the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is approximately 4.24 light-years away.\n\nThe time it would take to reach Proxima Centauri depends greatly on the speed of the spacecraft:\n\n1. **Current Spacecraft Speed**:\n   - The fastest spacecraft to date, the Parker Solar Probe, reaches speeds of about 430,000 miles per hour (700,000 kilometers per hour). At this speed, it would take over 17,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri.\n\n2. **Future Technology**:\n   - Concepts like Breakthrough Starshot propose spacecraft that could travel at up to 20% of the speed of light (0.2c) using light sails and powerful lasers. If successful, such missions could reach Proxima Centauri in about 20 years.\n\n3. **Speed of Light**:\n   - If we ever manage to develop a spacecraft that can travel at or very close to the speed of light, theoretically, it would take just over 4.24 years to reach Proxima Centauri.\n\nIn summary, with current technology, it would take tens of thousands of years to reach the nearest star. However, advancements in propulsion technology in the future could potentially reduce this travel time to a few decades.",
