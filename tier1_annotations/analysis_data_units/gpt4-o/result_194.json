A well-known example is the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), which are catadromous. This means they live parts of their lives in freshwater but migrate to the sea to spawn.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. Some eel species spawn in freshwater or brackish water rather than the open sea. The diversity of spawning habitats among eel species demonstrates the adaptability and varied life histories within the group.\n\nTo summarize, while many eel species spawn in the sea, particularly the more studied species of the Anguillidae family, there are species that spawn in freshwater or other environments.",
