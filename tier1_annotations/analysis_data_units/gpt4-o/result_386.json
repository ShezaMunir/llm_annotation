    "prompt": "How do I map over an array in Go?",
    "response": "In Go, the typical way to perform operations over an array (or slice) involves using a `for` loop, as the language lacks built-in higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce` found in other languages such as JavaScript or Python.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate how you can map over an array (or slice) and apply a function to each element:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// Define a function that we want to apply to each element.\nfunc square(n int) int {\n    return n * n\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Define an array (or slice, more commonly used in Go) of integers.\n    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n    // Create a new slice to store the result.\n    results := make([]int, len(numbers))\n\n    // Loop over the original array and apply the function.\n    for i, num := range numbers {\n        results[i] = square(num)\n    }\n\n    // Print the result.\n    fmt.Println(\"Original:\", numbers)\n    fmt.Println(\"Squared:\", results)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n1. We define a `square` function that takes an integer and returns its square.\n2. We create a slice of integers called `numbers`.\n3. We create an empty slice called `results` to hold the squared values. The `make` function is used to create a slice of the same length as `numbers`.\n4. We use a `for` loop with `range` to iterate over the `numbers` slice, apply the `square` function to each element, and store the result in the `results` slice.\n5. Finally, we print the original and squared slices.\n\nThis approach works well for most use cases in Go. If you find yourself needing more complex functional programming capabilities frequently, you might want to explore third-party libraries or write your own utility functions to bridge the gap.",
