    "prompt": "What are top few contenders for the most obnoxious pop song of the 1980's?",
    "response": "Determining the most obnoxious pop songs from the 1980s is subjective and can vary greatly depending on personal taste. However, several songs from that era often come up in discussions due to their repetitive nature, overexposure, or polarizing style. Here are a few contenders frequently cited in various lists and opinions:\n\n1. **\"We Built This City\" by Starship (1985)**\n   - Often criticized for its cheesy lyrics and synthetic sound, this song appears on many \"worst of\" lists despite its commercial success.\n\n2. **\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" by Wham! (1984)**\n   - While undeniably catchy, the song's relentlessly upbeat and sugary-sweet nature can be grating to some listeners.\n\n3. **\"The Final Countdown\" by Europe (1986)**\n   - With its grandiose keyboard riff and bombastic style, this track has been both loved for its epic feel and ridiculed for its over-the-top presentation.\n\n4. **\"Rock Me Amadeus\" by Falco (1985)**\n   - This quirky German pop-rap song, partially sung in German, can be considered jarring to those who aren't fans of its unconventional style.\n\n5. **\"Mickey\" by Toni Basil (1981)**\n   - The relentless cheerleader chant and repetitive chorus make this song a frequent mention in discussions of annoying hits.\n\n6. **\"Come On Eileen\" by Dexys Midnight Runners (1982)**\n   - While it has a strong following, the song's eclectic arrangement and sing-along chorus can be grating to some.\n\n7. **\"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley (1987)**\n   - Immortalized in internet culture through Rickrolling, some find the song's earnestness and saccharine melody irresistible, while others find it highly irritating.\n\n8. **\"Puttin' on the Ritz\" by Taco (1982)**\n   - This cover of an old classic, set to a 1980s new wave beat, is often mentioned for its odd juxtaposition and somewhat awkward execution.\n\nThese songs, while successful and beloved by many, also have their fair share of detractors who find certain elements obnoxious or overly repetitive.",
