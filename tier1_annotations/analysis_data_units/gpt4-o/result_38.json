    "prompt": "What is the different between (self, &self, &mut self, mut self) in Rust ?",
    "response": "In Rust, the different forms of `self` in method signatures indicate how the method borrows or owns the object it is being called on. Here's an explanation of each:\n\n1. `self`: When a method takes `self` as a parameter, it means the method takes ownership of the object. This consumes the object, meaning the object can no longer be used after the method call. This is often used when the method's purpose is to transform the object into something else and invalidate the original.\n\n   ```rust\n   impl MyStruct {\n       fn consume(self) {\n           // `self` is consumed here\n       }\n   }\n\n   let my_struct = MyStruct {};\n   my_struct.consume(); // my_struct is no longer valid after this\n   ```\n\n2. `&self`: When a method takes `&self` as a parameter, it means the method borrows the object immutably. This allows the method to read the object's data without changing it, and multiple immutable borrows are allowed concurrently. \n\n   ```rust\n   impl MyStruct {\n       fn read(&self) {\n           // Can read from `self` but cannot modify it\n       }\n   }\n\n   let my_struct = MyStruct {};\n   my_struct.read(); // You can still use `my_struct` after this\n   ```\n\n3. `&mut self`: When a method takes `&mut self` as a parameter, it means the method borrows the object mutably. This allows the method to modify the object's data. Only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time to ensure safety and avoid data races.\n\n   ```rust\n   impl MyStruct {\n       fn modify(&mut self) {\n           // Can modify `self`\n       }\n   }\n\n   let mut my_struct = MyStruct {};\n   my_struct.modify(); // You can still use my_struct, but it could be modified\n   ```\n\n4. `mut self`: There is no direct method signature in Rust that takes `mut self`, so this is likely a misunderstanding. However, you can declare a mutable binding to `self` inside the method to indicate that you want to mutate `self`:\n\n   ```rust\n   impl MyStruct {\n       fn modify(mut self) {\n           // `self` is taken by value, and the method can mutate it\n       }\n   }\n\n   let my_struct = MyStruct {};\n   my_struct.modify(); // my_struct is consumed and can no longer be used\n   ```\n\nIn summary:\n   - `self` takes ownership of the object.\n   - `&self` takes an immutable reference to the object.\n   - `&mut self` takes a mutable reference to the object.\n   - `mut self` is not a direct parameter type but provides a mutable binding within methods that take `self` by value.\n\nThis different usage of `self` helps Rust enforce strict ownership and borrowing rules, ensuring memory safety and preventing data races.",
