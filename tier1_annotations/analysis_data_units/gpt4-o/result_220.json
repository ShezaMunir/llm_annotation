    "prompt": "I would like to make a vegan, gluten-free pancake. What ingredients can I use?",
    "response": "Absolutely, you can make a delicious vegan and gluten-free pancake using the following ingredients:\n\n### Dry Ingredients:\n- **Gluten-Free Flour Blend**: 1 cup (you can use a pre-made blend or make your own using a mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch)\n- **Baking Powder**: 1 tablespoon\n- **Salt**: 1/4 teaspoon\n- **Ground Flaxseeds or Chia Seeds**: 1 tablespoon (mixed with 2.5 tablespoons of water to form a gel-like texture)\n\n### Wet Ingredients:\n- **Non-Dairy Milk**: 1 cup (almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, etc.)\n- **Maple Syrup or Agave Nectar**: 1 tablespoon (for a bit of sweetness)\n- **Vanilla Extract**: 1 teaspoon\n- **Neutral Oil or Melted Vegan Butter**: 1 tablespoon (optional, for additional moisture)\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Prepare the Flax/Chia Egg**: In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds or chia seeds with 2.5 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes gel-like.\n\n2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until well combined.\n\n3. **Mix Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, combine the non-dairy milk, maple syrup or agave nectar, vanilla extract, and optional oil or melted vegan butter. Add in the flax/chia egg mixture and whisk together.\n\n4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix; it's okay if there are a few lumps.\n\n5. **Cook the Pancakes**: Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with a small amount of oil if necessary. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side until golden brown.\n\n6. **Serve and Enjoy**: Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as fresh fruit, maple syrup, or nut butter.\n\nThese pancakes are fluffy, delicious, and suitable for those following a vegan and gluten-free diet. Enjoy your cooking!",
