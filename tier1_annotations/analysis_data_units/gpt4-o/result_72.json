The sixth KNOWLEDGE point shares a personal experience of learning about personal finance, but does not mention $5,000.\n7. The seventh KNOWLEDGE point is an introduction to an author who writes about personal finance topics, but does not mention $5,000.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe only KNOWLEDGE point that directly relates to the STATEMENT is the first one, which implies that $5,000 is a significant savings milestone. However, this point does not provide strong evidence to support or contradict the STATEMENT, as it does not provide any specific information about what $5,000 means or what it can be used for.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT is simply \"$5,000\", which is a vague statement without any context. To make it clearer, we could restate it as \"Having $5,000 in savings is a significant financial milestone.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, I would conclude that the evidence is [Unverifiable] because it does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the significance of $5,000 as a financial milestone. While one KNOWLEDGE point mentions that $5,000 is a significant savings milestone, it does not provide enough context or evidence to support or contradict the STATEMENT.",

The costs vary depending on the time of year, with autumn permits costing $5,500 per person.\n3. The equipment costs for climbing Mount Everest are around $8,000, and oxygen cylinders can cost an additional $3,000.\n4.
