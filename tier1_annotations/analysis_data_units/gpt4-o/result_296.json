This type of template provides a solid foundation and reusable components to accelerate development.\n\n---\n\n## Core React Project Template for Multiple React Sites\n\n### Overview\n\nThis core React project template aims to provide a base structure that can be easily cloned and extended to create new React applications. It includes essential configurations, libraries, and code structure to ensure that each new project has a consistent foundation, reducing redundancy and setup time.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. **Scalable Project Structure**:\n    - **`src/`**: Contains all source code files.\n      - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components across projects.\n      - **`pages/`**: Page-level components representing routes.\n      - **`layouts/`**: Layout components that wrap around pages.\n      - **`services/`**: API calls and integrations.\n      - **`contexts/`**: Context API implementations for global state management.\n      - **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for encapsulating logic.\n      - **`styles/`**: Global styles, themes, and CSS modules.\n      - **`utils/`**: Helper functions and utilities.\n    - **`public/`**: Public assets like HTML templates, images, etc.\n\n2. **Routing**:\n   - Uses `react-router-dom` for client-side routing, making it easy to add new routes and nested routes.\n\n3. **State Management**:\n   - Provides a simple setup using React Context for global state management. Optionally, supports integration with more complex state management libraries like Redux.\n\n4. **Styling**:\n   - Preconfigured for CSS Modules to scope styles locally.\n   - Includes a global stylesheet for common styles.\n   - Supports integration with CSS-in-JS libraries like `styled-components` or `emotion`.\n\n5. **Service Integration**:\n   - A designated folder for managing API calls using libraries like `axios` or `fetch` API.\n   - Structured to keep business logic separate from UI components.\n\n6. **Configuration**:\n   - **`.env` support**: For environment-specific variables.\n   - **Webpack/Babel configuration**: Optimized for React applications.\n\n7. **Testing**:\n   - Setup with `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for unit and integration tests.\n   - Sample test files included to show how to write tests.\n\n8. **Code Quality and Formatting**:\n   - Integrates `ESLint` for JavaScript linting and `Prettier` for code formatting.\n   - Pre-configured with common style guides like Airbnb.\n\n### Project Setup\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n   ```sh\n   git clone <repository-url> my-new-project\n   cd my-new-project\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   ```sh\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration**:\n   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize environment variables as needed.\n   - Adjust the configuration files (like `webpack.config.js` and `babel.config.js`) if there are specific needs.\n\n4. **Running the Project**:\n   ```sh\n   npm start\n   ```\n   This starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n5. **Building for Production**:\n   ```sh\n   npm run build\n   ```\n   This generates a `build/` folder with the production-ready code.\n\n### Extending the Template\n\n- **Adding a New Page**:\n  1. Create a new file under the `pages/` directory.\n  2. Define a new route in the `App.js` or `routes.js` file.\n\n- **Creating a New API Service**:\n  1. Add a new file in the `services/` directory.\n  2. Export functions to handle API calls which can be used within components or hooks.\n\n- **Adding Global Context**:\n  1. Create a new context in the `contexts/` directory.\n  2. Wrap the root component with the context provider in `index.js`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis core React project template provides a structured, scalable, and configurable foundation for developing multiple React applications. It incorporates best practices, integrates essential libraries, and ensures a consistent development experience across projects. By using this template, developers can focus more on building features rather than setting up the project structure from scratch.\n\n---",

The KNOWLEDGE points mention the advantages of React templates, including being dynamic, a good starting point for a project, and saving money.\n2. It also highlights the benefits of using `create-react-app`, which provides a working and up-to-date React app setup.\n3. Additionally, the KNOWLEDGE points mention the customization and flexibility of React Bootstrap templates.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that using a React template, such as the one provided by `create-react-app`, can save time and effort in setting up a project structure. This aligns with the STATEMENT, which suggests that using the core React project template allows developers to focus more on building features rather than setting up the project structure from scratch.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\nThe STATEMENT remains unchanged: By using the core React project template, developers can focus more on building features rather than setting up the project structure from scratch.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n[Supported]",
