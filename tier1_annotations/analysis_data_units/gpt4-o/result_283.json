    "response": "In the case of a theoretical constant current power supply, the device is designed to supply a fixed current regardless of the load impedance. When you disconnect the two leads and leave them floating, the load impedance effectively becomes infinite (an open circuit).\n\nSince the power supply is trying to maintain a constant current through an open circuit, the voltage across the leads would theoretically rise to an infinitely high value in an ideal world to maintain that current. However, in practical real-world power supplies, various limitations and protections are in place to prevent this from happening.\n\nTypically, a real constant current power supply has a maximum voltage limit for safety and to prevent damage to the power supply itself. Once the system hits this voltage limit, it won't increase further regardless of the open circuit condition, and the current will drop to zero. This voltage is often referred to as the compliance voltage or maximum output voltage of the power supply.\n\nIn summary, for a theoretical constant current power supply:\n- The voltage across the disconnected and floating leads would ideally be infinite.\n  \nFor a practical real-world constant current power supply:\n- The voltage will rise to the maximum voltage limit specified by the power supply's design.",
