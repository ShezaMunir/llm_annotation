    "prompt": "Name films like the video game Amnesia: Dark Descent",
    "response": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent is renowned for its atmospheric horror, tension, and psychological elements. If you're looking for films that capture similar feelings of dread, isolation, and psychological horror, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **The Descent (2005)** - A group of women exploring an uncharted cave find themselves pursued by terrifying creatures. The film captures claustrophobia and psychological tension well.\n\n2. **Silent Hill (2006)** - Based on the video game series, the film involves a mother searching for her lost daughter in the eerie, fog-shrouded town of Silent Hill, filled with nightmarish creatures.\n\n3. **The Babadook (2014)** - Centers on a mother and her son who are haunted by a sinister presence connected to a mysterious storybook. The film delves deep into psychological horror.\n\n4. **Session 9 (2001)** - A horror-thriller about an asbestos cleaning crew working in an abandoned mental hospital. The film builds tension through atmosphere and psychological dread.\n\n5. **Jacob's Ladder (1990)** - A psychological horror film about a Vietnam War vet experiencing increasingly disturbing hallucinations and realities, leading to a haunting conclusion.\n\n6. **The Others (2001)** - Set in a remote mansion right after World War II, where a woman and her two children start experiencing strange and unexplainable occurrences.\n\n7. **Event Horizon (1997)** - A sci-fi horror where a crew investigates a spacecraft that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned with something sinister on board.\n\n8. **The Witch (2015)** - A horror film set in 1630s New England where a family faces unsettling events after being banished to the edge of a dark forest.\n\n9. **Insidious (2010)** - Focuses on a family trying to prevent evil spirits from trapping their comatose child in a dark, ghostly realm.\n\n10. **Rosemary's Baby (1968)** - A classic psychological horror film about a young pregnant woman who suspects her unborn child may not be safe due to strange behaviors around her.\n\nThese films each offer an atmosphere that embodies some aspect of what makes Amnesia: The Dark Descent so compelling, from oppressive environments and psychological horror to supernatural elements and intense suspense.",
