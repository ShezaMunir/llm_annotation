    "prompt": "What are top few contenders for the most obnoxious pop song of the 1980's?",
    "response": "The 1980s - a decade of big hair, big phones, and even bigger personalities. And, of course, some of the most iconic (and cringe-worthy) pop songs of all time. Here are a few contenders for the most obnoxious pop song of the 1980s:\n\n1. **\"We Built This City\" by Starship (1985)**: This song is often cited as one of the worst songs of all time, and for good reason. Its cheesy lyrics, over-the-top production, and grating vocals make it a strong contender for most obnoxious.\n2. **\"Pac-Man Fever\" by Buckner & Garcia (1982)**: This novelty song is a perfect example of the decade's excesses. Its catchy-but-annoying melody and lyrics that are essentially just a list of Pac-Man sound effects make it a nostalgic nightmare.\n3. **\"The Safety Dance\" by Men Without Hats (1983)**: While some people might argue that this song is a quirky classic, others might find its repetitive melody, nonsensical lyrics, and Ivan Doroschuk's warbling vocals to be, well, obnoxious.\n4. **\"Muskrat Love\" by The Captain & Tennille (1980)**: This song's bizarre lyrics, which include sound effects and a spoken-word section about muskrats, are enough to drive some people crazy. Add in the duo's sugary sweet vocals, and you have a recipe for annoyance.\n5. **\"Funkytown\" by Lipps Inc. (1980)**: This synth-heavy dance track features a repetitive, ear-piercing melody and cringe-worthy lyrics that are more likely to induce eye-rolling than dancing.\n6. **\"Whip It\" by Devo (1980)**: While Devo is often praised for their innovative and influential music, \"Whip It\" is a polarizing song that some people find gratingly annoying. Its repetitive, new-wave beat and Mark Mothersbaugh's yelping vocals can be overwhelming.\n\nOf course, these are just a few examples, and opinions on the most obnoxious pop song of the 1980s will vary widely. Do you have a different song in mind that you think deserves the title?",
