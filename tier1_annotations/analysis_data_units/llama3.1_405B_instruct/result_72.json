    "prompt": "How much would it cost for an inexperienced person to climb mount everest.\nFirst consider the individual cost components.\nThen add them together.",
    "response": "Climbing Mount Everest is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning, preparation, and a substantial budget. The cost of climbing Mount Everest can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the route taken, the type of guided tour, and the level of support. Here's a breakdown of the individual cost components:\n\n**1. Climbing Permit:**\nThe Nepalese government charges a fee for climbing permits, which can range from $11,000 to $13,000 per person, depending on the season.\n\n**2. Guided Tour:**\nHiring a guided tour can be expensive, but it's highly recommended for inexperienced climbers. The cost of a guided tour can range from $30,000 to $100,000 per person, depending on the level of support and the reputation of the tour operator.\n\n**3. Climbing Gear and Equipment:**\nClimbing gear and equipment can be rented or purchased. The cost of renting gear can range from $2,000 to $5,000, while purchasing gear can cost $10,000 to $20,000 or more.\n\n**4. Transportation:**\nTransportation costs include flights from Kathmandu to Lukla (the starting point of the climb) and back, as well as transportation of gear and equipment. The cost of transportation can range from $1,000 to $3,000.\n\n**5. Accommodation and Food:**\nAccommodation and food costs can vary greatly depending on the type of accommodation and the location. Climbers can expect to pay $500 to $2,000 for accommodation and food in Kathmandu and $1,000 to $3,000 for accommodation and food on the mountain.\n\n**6. Oxygen Supply:**\nClimbers may need to purchase oxygen tanks and masks, which can cost $2,000 to $5,000.\n\n**7. Insurance:**\nClimbing insurance can cost $500 to $2,000, depending on the level of coverage.\n\n**8. Miscellaneous Costs:**\nMiscellaneous costs include expenses such as visa fees, vaccinations, and contingency funds. These costs can range from $1,000 to $3,000.\n\nNow, let's add up the individual cost components to estimate the total cost of climbing Mount Everest for an inexperienced person:\n\n**Low-End Estimate:**\n\n* Climbing Permit: $11,000\n* Guided Tour: $30,000\n* Climbing Gear and Equipment: $2,000 (rental)\n* Transportation: $1,000\n* Accommodation and Food: $1,500\n* Oxygen Supply: $2,000\n* Insurance: $500\n* Miscellaneous Costs: $1,000\n* Total: $49,000\n\n**Mid-Range Estimate:**\n\n* Climbing Permit: $12,000\n* Guided Tour: $50,000\n* Climbing Gear and Equipment: $5,000 (rental)\n* Transportation: $2,000\n* Accommodation and Food: $2,500\n* Oxygen Supply: $3,000\n* Insurance: $1,000\n* Miscellaneous Costs: $2,000\n* Total: $77,500\n\n**High-End Estimate:**\n\n* Climbing Permit: $13,000\n* Guided Tour: $100,000\n* Climbing Gear and Equipment: $10,000 (purchase)\n* Transportation: $3,000\n* Accommodation and Food: $3,500\n* Oxygen Supply: $5,000\n* Insurance: $2,000\n* Miscellaneous Costs: $3,000\n* Total: $139,500\n\nPlease note that these estimates are approximate and can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances.

To improve, I've constructed a more specific query that targets the cost aspect of climbing Mount Everest. By using \"breakdown\" and \"expenses for Everest expedition\", I'm hoping to get a detailed estimate of the costs involved, which will help verify the statement's claim of a \"substantial budget\" being required.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"Mount Everest climbing costs breakdown\" \"expenses for Everest expedition\" \"average cost of climbing Everest\"\n```\n\nLet me know if this meets the criteria!"

To improve our query, we'll target specific sources that are likely to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs involved, such as guide services, agencies, or operators that offer Everest expeditions.
