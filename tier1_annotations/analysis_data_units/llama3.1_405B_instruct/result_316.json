By replacing \"They\" with \"the buckets\", we provide the necessary context to understand the UNIT.\n\n```\nThe buckets are the same weight, 1 kilogram.\n```"

                    "explanation": "**Round 5**\n\n**Constructed Query:**\n```\n(\"identical buckets\" OR \"buckets of equal mass\") 1 kilogram experiment physics \"weight measurement\"\n```\n**Query Rationale:**\nIn this round, I'm building upon the previous queries by adding the phrase \"weight measurement\" to the search query. This is because the statement specifically mentions that the buckets are the same weight, 1 kilogram. By including this phrase, I'm hoping to find experiments or resources that focus on measuring the weight of identical buckets, which could provide evidence to support or refute the statement.\n\n**Rationale for using \"weight measurement\":**\nThe previous queries didn't yield relevant results, possibly because they were too broad or didn't capture the specific aspect of weight measurement. By adding this phrase, I'm targeting searches that explicitly discuss measuring the weight of identical buckets, which should provide more relevant and targeted results."
