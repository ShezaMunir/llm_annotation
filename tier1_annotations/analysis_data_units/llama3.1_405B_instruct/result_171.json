    "prompt": "What most interesting and satisfying skill in Disco Elysium and why? Also what skill is useless?",
    "response": "Disco Elysium is a groundbreaking RPG that offers a wide range of skills to shape your detective's abilities and interactions. While opinions may vary, I'll provide an analysis of the most interesting and satisfying skill, as well as the one that's often considered less useful.\n\n**Most interesting and satisfying skill: Inland Empire**\n\nInland Empire is a fascinating skill that represents your detective's intuition, creativity, and ability to think outside the box. It allows you to tap into your subconscious mind, making connections between seemingly unrelated things, and granting you access to unique insights and observations.\n\nWith Inland Empire, you'll experience:\n\n1. **Unconventional solutions**: Inland Empire can help you find innovative solutions to puzzles and problems, often by making unexpected connections between clues.\n2. **Enhanced observations**: This skill allows you to notice subtle details that might otherwise go unnoticed, such as hidden objects, unusual patterns, or inconsistencies in NPC statements.\n3. **Creative interactions**: Inland Empire enables you to engage in imaginative conversations, using your intuition to guide the discussion and uncover new information.\n\nInland Empire is satisfying because it rewards creative thinking and encourages exploration. By investing in this skill, you'll develop a deeper understanding of the game's world and its intricate mysteries.\n\n**Least useful skill: Shivers**\n\nShivers is a skill that represents your detective's physical sensitivity and awareness of their surroundings. While it has some niche applications, it's often considered the least useful skill in the game.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Limited applications**: Shivers is primarily used to detect and analyze physical sensations, such as smells, sounds, or vibrations. However, these situations are relatively rare and often not crucial to the investigation.\n2. **Overlapping with other skills**: Some of the functions of Shivers, like detecting hidden objects, can be replicated with other skills like Inland Empire or Visual Calculus.\n3. **Less impactful interactions**: Shivers-based interactions tend to be more straightforward and lack the creative depth and complexity offered by other skills like Inland Empire or Logic.\n\nKeep in mind that every skill in Disco Elysium has its unique applications and uses. While Shivers might be considered less useful, it's still a valuable part of the game's intricate skill system.\n\nRemember, the beauty of Disco Elysium lies in its complexity and depth. Experiment with different skills and playstyles to find what works best for you and your detective.",
