The high glycolic index and limited protein content also make them unsuitable as a meal replacement.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nA Clif Bar, a popular energy bar, should not be relied upon as a meal replacement due to its limited nutritional adequacy and high glycolic index.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Contradicted]",
