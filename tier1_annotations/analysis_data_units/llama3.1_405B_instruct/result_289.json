The addition of `multilingual` and `cross-lingual` keywords aims to explore the language-agnostic aspects of date recognition and parsing in non-Gregorian calendars, which is a crucial aspect of the STATEMENT. By including `language-agnostic`, we can uncover information on how date recognition systems handle dates in various languages and formats.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(non-Gregorian calendars OR alternative calendars) AND (natural language understanding OR multilingual) AND (date recognition OR date parsing) AND (cross-lingual OR language-agnostic)\n```"

By using the `OR` operator to connect these phrases, we can capture a broader range of relevant results. The use of `multilingual` and `cross-lingual` keywords helps to focus on date parsing and recognition across different languages, while `language-agnostic` and `calendar-agnostic` terms aim to retrieve information on date processing that is independent of specific languages or calendars.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(non-Gregorian calendars OR alternative calendars) AND (multilingual date parsing OR cross-lingual date recognition) AND (language-agnostic date understanding OR calendar-agnostic date processing)\n```"
