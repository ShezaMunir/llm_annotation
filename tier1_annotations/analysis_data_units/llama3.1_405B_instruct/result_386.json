    "prompt": "How do I map over an array in Go?",
    "response": "In Go, you can map over an array (or a slice) using a `for` loop. Here's an example:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    // Create an array\n    arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}\n\n    // Map over the array\n    for i, value := range arr {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Index: %d, Value: %d\\n\", i, value)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `range` keyword is used to iterate over the array. The `for` loop will execute once for each element in the array, with `i` taking on the index of the current element and `value` taking on the value of the current element.\n\nIf you only need to access the value and not the index, you can ignore the index variable using the blank identifier `_`:\n\n```go\nfor _, value := range arr {\n    fmt.Println(value)\n}\n```\n\nNote that this will work for slices as well, not just arrays.\n\n### Mapping with a function\n\nIf you want to apply a transformation to each element of the array, you can use a function:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc double(x int) int {\n    return x * 2\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}\n    for _, value := range arr {\n        fmt.Println(double(value))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will print the doubled values of each element in the array.\n\n### Using a higher-order function\n\nGo does not have built-in support for higher-order functions like `map` or `filter`, but you can write your own:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc mapFunc(arr []int, fn func(int) int) []int {\n    result := make([]int, len(arr))\n    for i, value := range arr {\n        result[i] = fn(value)\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\nfunc double(x int) int {\n    return x * 2\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    arr := []int{1, 2, 3}\n    doubled := mapFunc(arr, double)\n    fmt.Println(doubled)\n}\n```\n\nThis will print the doubled values of each element in the slice. Note that this implementation only works for slices, not arrays.",
