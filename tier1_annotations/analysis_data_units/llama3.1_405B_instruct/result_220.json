    "response": "Making vegan and gluten-free pancakes can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I've got you covered. Here are some ingredients you can use to make delicious and fluffy pancakes:\n\n**Flour alternatives:**\n\n1. Almond flour: Made from ground almonds, this flour is a popular choice for gluten-free baking.\n2. Coconut flour: A fiber-rich flour made from dried coconut, but note that it absorbs more liquid than traditional flour, so you may need to adjust the liquid content.\n3. Rice flour: A light and delicate flour made from white or brown rice.\n4. Gluten-free oat flour: Some brands offer gluten-free oats that can be blended into a flour.\n5. Teff flour: A nutrient-rich flour made from the ancient grain teff.\n\n**Non-dairy milk:**\n\n1. Almond milk\n2. Soy milk\n3. Coconut milk\n4. Oat milk\n5. Rice milk\n\n**Egg replacers:**\n\n1. Flaxseed meal: Mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 3 tablespoons of water to replace one egg.\n2. Chia seeds: Mix 1 tablespoon of chia seeds with 3 tablespoons of water to replace one egg.\n3. Mashed banana: One ripe mashed banana can replace one egg.\n4. Applesauce: Use 1/4 cup of applesauce to replace one egg.\n5. Commercial egg replacers like Ener-G Egg Replacer or Bob's Red Mill Egg Replacer.\n\n**Other ingredients:**\n\n1. Sugar or natural sweeteners like maple syrup or coconut sugar\n2. Vegan butter or oil (e.g., coconut oil or avocado oil)\n3. Vanilla extract\n4. Baking powder (make sure it's gluten-free)\n5. Salt\n\n**Tips:**\n\n1.
