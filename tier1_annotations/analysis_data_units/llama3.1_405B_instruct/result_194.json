While many species of eel, such as the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), are catadromous, meaning they migrate from freshwater or brackish water to the ocean to spawn, some species of eel are not.\n\nSome species of eel, such as the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) and the swamp eel (Monopterus albus), are freshwater eels that spawn in freshwater environments, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These eels do not migrate to the ocean to spawn and instead complete their life cycle in freshwater.\n\nAdditionally, some species of eel, such as the moray eels (family Muraenidae), are marine eels that spawn in the ocean, but do not migrate to freshwater environments at any stage of their life cycle.\n\nSo, while many species of eel do spawn in the sea, not all species of eel do so. The spawning habits of eels can vary greatly depending on the species and their specific life cycle.",
