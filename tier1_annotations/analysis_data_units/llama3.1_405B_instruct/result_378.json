    "response": "The cheapest GPU EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS) can vary depending on the region, availability, and the specific GPU model. However, I can give you some general information on the most affordable GPU instances available on EC2.\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, the cheapest GPU instance on EC2 is the **g4dn.xlarge** instance, which features an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with 16 GB of GDDR6 memory. This instance is available in several regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland).\n\nHere's a rough estimate of the costs:\n\n* **On-Demand pricing**:\n\t+ Linux/Unix: $0.655 per hour (effective hourly rate)\n\t+ Windows: $0.735 per hour (effective hourly rate)\n* **Reserved Instance (RI) pricing** (1-year commitment):\n\t+ Linux/Unix: $0.375 per hour (effective hourly rate)\n\t+ Windows: $0.455 per hour (effective hourly rate)\n\nKeep in mind that prices may vary depending on your region, and you should always check the official AWS pricing page for the most up-to-date information.\n\nOther affordable GPU instances on EC2 include:\n\n* **g4ad.xlarge** (NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GB of HBM2 memory)\n* **p3.2xlarge** (NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 16 GB of HBM2 memory)\n\nPlease note that these instances are subject to availability and might not be available in all regions.\n\nBefore choosing an instance, make sure to review the instance type's specifications, pricing, and availability to ensure it meets your requirements.",
