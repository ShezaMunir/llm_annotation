Here's how to think about it:\n\n**Ideal Constant Current Source:**\n\n* **Definition:**  An ideal constant current source will *always* output its specified current, regardless of the load resistance.\n* **Open Circuit:**  If the leads are disconnected, you've created an infinitely high resistance.  To maintain a constant current flow through infinite resistance, the voltage would have to rise to infinity.\n\n**Reality Check:**\n\n* **Physical Limitations:**  In reality, a power supply claiming to be \"constant current\" will have a voltage limit.  Once the voltage reaches its maximum, it can no longer increase the current. At this point, it will no longer behave as a true constant current source.\n* **Open Circuit Behavior:** With disconnected leads, a real-world constant current supply would likely:\n    * **Reach its maximum voltage output.**\n    * **Potentially trigger a safety mechanism** (e.g., overvoltage protection, current limiting) to prevent damage.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhile an ideal constant current source would produce infinite voltage across an open circuit, this is impossible in practice.  A real constant current power supply has a maximum voltage limit, and exceeding this limit will lead to either a plateau in voltage or the activation of safety features. \n",
