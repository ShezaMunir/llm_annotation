Choose a region closer to your users or with lower costs.\n* **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances:** Explore these options if you have predictable, long-term usage.\n* **Free Tier:** If you're new to AWS, you might qualify for free usage under the AWS Free Tier.\n\n**Remember:**\n* Prices on the AWS website are always the most up-to-date.\n* Carefully evaluate your workload's GPU requirements to choose the most cost-effective option, not just the absolute cheapest. \n",
