The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that the `src` folder is a common directory in React projects, and that files inside `src` are visible to Webpack.\n3. One of the KNOWLEDGE points mentions that the author creates the following directories under `src`: `pages`, `components`, `layouts`, `configs`, `contexts`, and `utils`.\n4. Another KNOWLEDGE point mentions that there is no recommended way to structure React projects, but `create-react-app` can be used to create a file structure to follow.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points provide mixed evidence regarding the existence of a `layouts` folder in the `src` folder of a core React project template.\n\nOn one hand, one of the KNOWLEDGE points explicitly mentions that the author creates a `layouts` folder under `src`. This suggests that it is possible to have a `layouts` folder in the `src` folder.\n\nOn the other hand, another KNOWLEDGE point mentions that there is no recommended way to structure React projects, and that `create-react-app` can be used to create a file structure to follow. This implies that the existence of a `layouts` folder is not guaranteed in a core React project template.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT can be rephrased as: \"The `src` folder in a React project template may include a `layouts` folder, but it is not a required or guaranteed directory.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the evaluation, I conclude that the STATEMENT is [Unverifiable]. The KNOWLEDGE points provide conflicting evidence, and it is unclear whether a `layouts` folder is a standard directory in a core React project template.",

This increases the likelihood of finding relevant, code-based results related to the `core-react-template`. The addition of `filetype:md` filters the results to only include Markdown files, which are commonly used for documentation and READMEs in GitHub repositories.
