    "prompt": "How do I map over an array in Go?",
    "response": "Go doesn't have a built-in \"map\" function like some other languages for directly transforming arrays. Instead, you use loops to iterate and apply a transformation function to each element. Here's a breakdown with examples:\n\n**1. Using a `for` loop:**\n\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   import \"fmt\"\n\n   func main() {\n       numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n       // Function to double a number\n       double := func(n int) int {\n           return n * 2\n       }\n\n       // Create a new slice to store the results\n       doubledNumbers := make([]int, len(numbers))\n\n       // Iterate and apply the transformation\n       for i, num := range numbers {\n           doubledNumbers[i] = double(num)\n       }\n\n       fmt.Println(doubledNumbers) // Output: [2 4 6 8 10]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **Explanation:**\n\n   - **Transformation Function:** We define a `double` function that takes an integer and returns its doubled value.\n   - **Iteration and Application:**  We use a `for` loop with `range` to iterate over the `numbers` array. Inside the loop:\n     - `i` represents the current index.\n     - `num` represents the current element's value.\n     - We call `double(num)` to apply the transformation and store the result in the corresponding index of the `doubledNumbers` slice.\n\n**2. Using Generics (Go 1.18 and above):**\n\n   With generics, you can create a reusable `map` function:\n\n   ```go\n   package main\n\n   import \"fmt\"\n\n   func mapSlice[T, U any](s []T, f func(T) U) []U {\n       result := make([]U, len(s))\n       for i, v := range s {\n           result[i] = f(v)\n       }\n       return result\n   }\n\n   func main() {\n       numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n       doubledNumbers := mapSlice(numbers, func(n int) int { return n * 2 })\n       fmt.Println(doubledNumbers) // Output: [2 4 6 8 10]\n\n       strings := []string{\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n       upperStrings := mapSlice(strings, func(s string) string { return strings.ToUpper(s) })\n       fmt.Println(upperStrings) // Output: [APPLE BANANA CHERRY]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   **Explanation:**\n\n   - **Generic `mapSlice` Function:** This function works with any slice type (`T`) and any return type (`U`) from the transformation function (`f`). \n   - **Usage:** We can now use `mapSlice` to apply different transformations to different data types.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **No In-Place Modification:** Go's approach creates a *new* slice with the transformed elements. This is because arrays in Go have a fixed size.\n- **Choose Based on Go Version:** If you're using Go 1.18 or later, generics offer a more reusable and type-safe way to implement mapping. \n\nLet me know if you'd like more specific examples or have a particular transformation in mind! \n",

The KNOWLEDGE points explain the characteristics of arrays and slices in Go, including their fixed/dynamic size, contiguous memory storage, and passing by value/reference.\n2. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that slices are built on top of arrays and can grow or shrink, whereas arrays have a fixed size.\n3. The STATEMENT mentions that Go's approach creates a new slice with transformed elements because arrays in Go have a fixed size.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that the STATEMENT is true. The fact that arrays in Go have a fixed size means that they cannot be resized or modified dynamically. Therefore, when transforming elements, a new slice needs to be created to accommodate the changes. This is supported by the KNOWLEDGE points that highlight the differences between arrays and slices, including their size flexibility.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT can be restated as: \"In Go, arrays have a fixed size, which is why a new slice is created when transforming elements.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
