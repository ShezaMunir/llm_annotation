The KNOWLEDGE points emphasize that mass is a fundamental measurement of an object's matter, while weight is a force dependent on gravity.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, the evidence suggests that weight is not exactly about mass, but rather about the gravitational force acting on an object's mass.
