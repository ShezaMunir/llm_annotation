    "prompt": "What are top few contenders for the most obnoxious pop song of the 1980's?",
    "response": "Declaring a song the \"most obnoxious\" is inherently subjective, as what grates on one person's nerves might be another's guilty pleasure.  However, considering factors like overplayed nature, simplistic lyrics, and potentially irritating musical elements, here are a few contenders for the most obnoxious pop songs of the 1980s, with the understanding that this is all in good fun:\n\n**High Recognition/Overplayed Factor:**\n\n* **\"We Built This City\" - Starship (1985):** Often cited as one of the worst songs ever, its overplayed status and cheesy lyrics about rock 'n' roll make it a strong contender.\n* **\"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" - Wham! (1984):**  George Michael's vocals are undeniably catchy, but the relentless cheerfulness and repetitive chorus can be grating.\n* **\"Mickey\" - Toni Basil (1982):**  That cheerleading chant... need we say more? Its infectious energy can easily tip into annoying territory.\n\n**Lyrically Questionable:**\n\n* **\"My Sharona\" - The Knack (1979):**  While technically released in 1979, its popularity soared in the early 80s. The stalker-ish lyrics about an underage girl are super creepy.\n* **\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" - Dead or Alive (1985):** Repetitive lyrics and the androgynous, heavily-styled image of the band might have been jarring to some.\n\n**Musically Grating (Potentially):**\n\n* **\"Relax\" - Frankie Goes to Hollywood (1983):**  While groundbreaking for its suggestive content, the repetitive synth and spoken-word sections could be considered annoying by some.\n* **\"Karma Chameleon\" - Culture Club (1983):**  Boy George's distinctive vocals and the song's catchy melody can wear thin upon repeated listens.\n\nIt's important to remember that \"obnoxious\" is subjective!  Many people love these songs for their nostalgic value or just plain catchy hooks. What you find irritating, others may find endearing. \n",
