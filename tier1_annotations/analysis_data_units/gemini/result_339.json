The second KNOWLEDGE point compares Huel and Soylent, stating that Soylent's drinks are thinner than Huel's due to Huel's added fiber content.\n3. The third KNOWLEDGE point contrasts Huel's texture with another product, describing Huel's texture as \"grainy chunkiness\" similar to a fruit smoothie, whereas the other product has a smooth and light texture like milk.\n4. The third KNOWLEDGE point also explains that Huel's texture is primarily due to the use of rolled oats and flaxseeds, which form a gel-like substance when mixed with liquids.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, it appears that Huel's texture is distinct from Soylent's. The second KNOWLEDGE point explicitly states that Soylent's drinks are thinner than Huel's, and the third KNOWLEDGE point describes Huel's texture as \"grainy chunkiness\" compared to the other product's smooth texture.
