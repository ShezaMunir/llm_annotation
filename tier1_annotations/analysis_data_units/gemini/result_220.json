    "response": "Here's your guide to vegan, gluten-free pancake ingredients:\n\n**The Foundation**\n\n* **Gluten-Free Flour Blend:** The key is using a blend designed for baking, ensuring lightness. Look for:\n    * **Pre-made blends:** Many brands offer excellent all-purpose gluten-free blends.\n    * **DIY blend:**  Combine brown rice flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch (equal parts). \n\n* **Binding Agent (replaces eggs):**\n    * **Flaxseed \"Egg\":** 1 tbsp ground flaxseed + 3 tbsp water, whisked and rested for 5 minutes\n    * **Chia Seed \"Egg\":** Same ratio as flaxseed\n    * **Mashed Banana:** Adds sweetness too! \n    * **Applesauce:** About 1/4 cup per \"egg\"\n\n* **Liquid:** \n    * **Non-Dairy Milk:** Almond, soy, oat, etc. \u2013 choose your favorite!\n    * **Water:** Works in a pinch\n\n* **Leavener:**\n    * **Baking Powder:** Essential for fluffy pancakes\n\n* **Sweetener (optional):**\n    * **Maple Syrup:** Adds a touch of natural sweetness\n    * **Sugar:** White or brown sugar works\n    * **Agave Nectar:**  A vegan-friendly alternative\n\n**Flavor Enhancers:**\n\n* **Vanilla Extract:** A touch enhances the overall flavor\n* **Cinnamon:** Warm and comforting\n* **Nutmeg:** Adds a hint of warmth\n* **Salt:** A pinch balances the sweetness\n\n**Mix-Ins for Fun:**\n\n* **Fresh Berries:** Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries\n* **Chocolate Chips:**  Because who can resist?\n* **Nuts:** Chopped walnuts, pecans, or almonds add crunch\n* **Seeds:**  Pumpkin, sunflower, or hemp seeds for extra nutrition\n\n**Important Tips:**\n\n* **Don't overmix:**  Overmixing develops gluten in regular flour, but in gluten-free it can make your pancakes tough. Mix until just combined.\n* **Let the batter rest:** 5-10 minutes allows the starches to absorb liquid for better texture.\n* **Cook over medium heat:**  Gluten-free pancakes need a bit longer to cook through. \n\n**Enjoy experimenting!  Pancakes are a blank canvas for creativity. Let me know if you'd like a specific recipe!** \n",
