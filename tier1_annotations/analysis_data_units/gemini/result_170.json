The KNOWLEDGE points highlight the non-linear structure of the film \"Memento\" (2000), which is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout the film.\n2. The non-linear narrative is meant to display Leonard's inability to remember, showing a mixed series of events out of order.\n3. The film's screenplay was based on a pitch by Jonathan Nolan, who wrote the short story \"Memento Mori\".\n4. The film is described as a \"diabolical and absorbing experience\" and a \"puzzle structure\" that creates a visceral thrill.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that the STATEMENT is accurate. The non-linear structure of the film is designed to create a puzzle-like experience for the audience, mirroring Leonard's inability to remember. The film's narrative is intentionally presented in a mixed order to enhance the suspense and mystery. Although the KNOWLEDGE points do not explicitly mention finding his wife's killer, they suggest that the film's puzzle structure is meant to create a sense of mystery and suspense, which aligns with the STATEMENT.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nMemento (2000) employs a non-linear narrative structure to create a suspenseful puzzle that mirrors the protagonist's experience, which revolves around finding his wife's killer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
