    "prompt": "What are some theories about the meaning of life?",
    "response": "## Theories About the Meaning of Life: A Diverse Landscape\n\nThe question of life's meaning is a perennial one, with no single, universally accepted answer. Here are some prominent theories from different perspectives:\n\n**1. Supernaturalism:**\n\n* **Divine purpose:** Many religions believe life's meaning comes from fulfilling a purpose given by a higher power. This could involve following divine commandments, serving others, or achieving enlightenment.\n* **Karma and reincarnation:**  Some Eastern philosophies posit that life's meaning lies in accruing good karma through righteous actions to escape the cycle of reincarnation and achieve liberation.\n\n**2. Naturalism:**\n\n* **Nihilism:** This view suggests life is inherently meaningless, with no objective purpose or value. We are simply biological organisms driven by survival instincts.\n* **Existentialism:** This perspective argues that while life has no inherent meaning, we have the freedom and responsibility to create our own meaning and values.\n\n**3. Subjective Theories:**\n\n* **Hedonism:** This theory equates meaning with maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. \n* **Epicureanism:** A nuanced form of hedonism, emphasizing finding joy in simple pleasures and living a virtuous life.\n* **Subjective Value Theory:** This perspective argues that meaning is derived from personal values and goals, whatever they may be.\n\n**4. Objective Theories:**\n\n* **Eudaimonism:** This ancient Greek philosophy posits that meaning stems from living a virtuous and fulfilling life aligned with one's true nature.\n* **Objectivism:** A philosophy developed by Ayn Rand, emphasizes the pursuit of personal happiness as the highest moral purpose, achieved through reason and productive achievement.\n\n**5. Hybrid Theories:**\n\n* **Absurdism:**  Embraces the inherent conflict between our desire for meaning and the universe's indifference, finding meaning in the act of rebellion against this absurdity.\n* **Humanism:**  Focuses on human reason, ethics, and the pursuit of human flourishing as sources of meaning, often emphasizing our interconnectedness and responsibility to one another.\n\n**It's important to note:**\n\n* These are just a few examples, and many variations and nuances exist within each theory.\n* No single theory holds a monopoly on truth, and individuals may find resonance with elements from different perspectives.\n* The search for life's meaning is a personal journey, and what resonates with one person may not resonate with another. \n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a question each individual must grapple with and answer for themselves. It's a journey of self-discovery, exploration, and reflection. \n",

To improve the query, I've added more specific keywords related to philosophy, ethics, and morality to narrow down the search. By including `OR` operators, we can capture variations in language used to describe hedonism. Excluding `epicureanism` helps to focus on hedonism as a broader concept, rather than a specific school of thought.\n\n**Rationale Continues:**\nThis query builds upon the previous effort by refining the search terms to better capture the nuances of hedonism as a philosophical concept. By incorporating ethics and morality, we're more likely to find relevant results that discuss the implications of hedonism on human values and decision-making, which can help verify the accuracy of the statement.\n\nLet me know if this query meets the criteria!"
