    "prompt": "Do all species of eel spawn in the sea?",
    "response": "That's a great question, and it highlights a mysterious aspect of eel life! While it's true that **most** eel species spawn in the sea, it's not entirely accurate to say **all** do. Here's why:\n\n* **Catadromous nature:** Most eels are catadromous, meaning they live in freshwater but migrate to the ocean to spawn. Famous examples include the American eel and European eel, whose incredible journeys to the Sargasso Sea continue to fascinate scientists.\n* **Exceptions exist:** There are exceptions to this rule. Some eel species live their entire lives and reproduce in freshwater. These are generally classified as \"freshwater eels\" even though they belong to the same Anguilliformes order.\n* **Limited knowledge:**  Our understanding of eel reproduction is surprisingly incomplete. Some deep-sea eel species have never been observed spawning, so their exact habits remain a mystery. \n\n**In conclusion:** While the vast majority of eels spawn in the sea, we cannot definitively say ALL do. More research is needed, especially on elusive deep-sea species, to fully unravel the reproductive secrets of these fascinating creatures. \n",
