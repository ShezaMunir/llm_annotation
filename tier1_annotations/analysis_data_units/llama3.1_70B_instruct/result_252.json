The 4770k is a great processor, but it's old by CPU standards.\nThe question isn't whether the 3700x is better, it's whether it's worth the upgrade cost.

The KNOWLEDGE points also compare the performance of the i7-4770K to other processors, showing that it has a lower performance compared to newer processors.\n3.

By removing these results, we can focus on finding information about the PCIe 4.0 support in earlier Ryzen generations, specifically the Ryzen 1000 and 2000 series. This query is likely to uncover new information that can help verify or refute the statement's claim.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe previous rounds have established that the Ryzen 5000 and 3000 series support PCIe 4.0, but we still need to investigate the earlier generations. By excluding these series from the search, we can target the Ryzen 1000 and 2000 series, which are more relevant to the statement's claim.
