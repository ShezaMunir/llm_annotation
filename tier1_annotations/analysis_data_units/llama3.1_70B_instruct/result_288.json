Would it be possible to have this flag in a future version?\n\nTo summarize, my question is whether it's currently possible to download a `Dockerfile` with any official Docker tools or if there's a workaround to achieve this.\n\nThere is a related question on Stack Overflow, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32792592/how-do-i-get-the-dockerfile-of-a-docker-hub-image.\n\nHowever, the answers provided in that SO question can be improved and since the DockerHub API (as well as Docker itself) has likely evolved since '15, I'd like to know if there are more up-to-date solutions. Thank you.\n\nFor readers' clarification, I'm including a possible solution that uses Docker Hub's API v2, as you can get a lot of metadata about an image (e.g., its tags, its creation time, its layers, etc.). However, you won't get its actual `Dockerfile`. If someone finds it useful for their application, please let me know and we can add some error checking and content formatting.\n\nHere's the aforementioned possible solution that uses API v2:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nusername='%%USERNAME%%'\nimage='%%IMAGE_NAME%%'\n\napi_url=\"https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/${username}/${image}/tags/\"\n\nresponse=$(curl -s -X GET \"${api_url}\")\necho \"${response}\"\n```\n\nFor example, using the Docker repository owned by the library organization: `https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/debian/tags/`.\n\n\n\nThe possible solution I provide does get the \"tags\" from Docker Hub using v2 of the Docker Hub API. But looking at other [tagged Docker Hub issues](https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3ADockerfile), it does seem that Docker (the company) doesn't currently support obtaining a Dockerfile of a certain image via their APIs (or executables).\n\nHence, we have no other choice but to search in other places; for example, if a GitHub repository tag starts with \"v\" and has many tags for its Docker images, we can make the educated guess that an image_name starts with the tag \"v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}\", which therefore (in most cases) means to a certain degree that it's derived from that file, if it's tagged in a semver-like way.\n\nTo get the main branch Dockerfile, search something like: `${GITHUB_ORG}/${GITHUB_REPO}/blob/master/Dockerfile`.\n\nHTH.\n\n\n\nYou can use the [Docker Hub API](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/api/latest/) to fetch the Dockerfile of a public image.\n\nHere's an example Python script to do this:\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef get_dockerfile(image_name):\n    url = f\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/library/{image_name}/dockerfile\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        print(response.text)\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve Dockerfile\")\n\n# Usage\nget_dockerfile(\"debian\")\n```\nThis script fetches the Dockerfile of the `debian` image from the Docker Hub. Note that this only works for public images in the `library` namespace (i.e., official images).\n\nAs for `docker-compose.yml`, it's not stored in Docker Hub, so you can't retrieve it through the API. However, you can try searching for the GitHub repository associated with the image and look for the `docker-compose.yml` file there.\n\nPlease note that not all images have their Dockerfile publicly available, and some might be built from private repositories.\n\nAs for the `docker pull` command, it's not possible to use a `--format` flag to retrieve the Dockerfile. The `docker pull` command only downloads the image layers, not the Dockerfile.\n\nThe API endpoint used in the script above is not officially documented, but it's been used in various scripts and tools for fetching Dockerfiles. However, be aware that it might be subject to change or removal without notice.\n\nFor cases where the image is not in the `library` namespace, you can try using the following URL: `https://registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/${username}/${image_name}/dockerfile`. Replace `${username}` and `${image_name}` with the actual values for the image you're interested in.\n\nAlso, be aware that some images might have multiple Dockerfiles (e.g., for different architectures), so you might need to modify the script to handle those cases.\n\nHope this helps!
