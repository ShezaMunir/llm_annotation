The KNOWLEDGE points out that the Kepler space telescope was designed to search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of stars.\n2. The discovery of Kepler-186f confirms that planets the size of Earth exist in the habitable zone of stars other than the Sun.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE mentions that ten near-Earth-sized planets orbit in their star's habitable zone, and four planets have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE also mentions that a dozen of the 1,030 confirmed planets from Kepler are less than twice the size of Earth.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE strongly implies and directly supports the STATEMENT. The evidence suggests that Kepler's K2 mission has discovered multiple Earth-sized planets within the habitable zone of nearby stars. Specifically, the discovery of Kepler-186f and the confirmation of four planets through the K2 mission provide strong evidence for the STATEMENT.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe Kepler space telescope (K2) has discovered multiple Earth-sized planets with similar conditions, within the habitable zone of nearby stars.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
