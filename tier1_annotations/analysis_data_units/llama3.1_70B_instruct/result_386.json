    "prompt": "How do I map over an array in Go?",
    "response": "I receive a generic slice of T and in the return I expect to get a new slice with modified T. If the transformation to get from T to T\u2019 is complex enough I don\u2019t want it is inlined in the map function. Is there idiomatic way to perform map operation?\n\nFor example, let\u2019s consider this simple transformation of string slice to string slice with each string trimmed with the package \u201cioutil\u201d and where the \u201cioutil\u201d function model the complex transformation:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc MapSlice[T string](ts []T)(out []T) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        out = append(out, transform(elem))\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc transform(s string) string {\n    return strings.TrimSpace(s)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    slice := []string{\"one\", \" two\", \" three \"}\n    for i, s := range MapSlice(slice) {\n        fmt.Println(i, s)\n    }\n}\n\n```\nI can modify the code to be\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc MapSlice[T any](ts []T, transform func(T) T)(out []T) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        out = append(out, transform(elem))\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc transform(s string) string {\n    return strings.TrimSpace(s)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    slice := []string{\"one\", \" two\", \" three \"}\n    for i, s := range MapSlice(slice, func(s string) string { return transform(s) }) {\n        fmt.Println(i, s)\n    }\n}\n\n```\nand then change the main code to make MapSlice flexible in term of type T\n```go\nfunc main() {\n    slice := []string{\"one\", \" two\", \" three \"}\n    for i, s := range MapSlice(slice, func(s string) string { return transform(s) }) {\n        fmt.Println(i, s)\n    }\n\n    sliceN := []int{1, 2, 3}\n    for i, s := range MapSlice(sliceN, func(n int) int { return n + 10 }) {\n        fmt.Println(i, s)\n    }\n}\n```\nI expect the compiler to not allow me launching the program if I would send a function which return a different type instead of T.\n\nBut in my actual code I have a transformation like string to another type T\u2019 this is why I want to have an handler which is `func(T) T\u2019`.\nThe code I have right now looks like this\n```go\nfunc MapSlice[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) TOut)(out []TOut) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        out = append(out, transform(elem))\n    }\n    return\n}\n```\nYes you can have `func(T) T\u2019` signature for the handler. The main point was to separate the handler from the loop and it looks it does not matter where the function is declared: either within `MapSlice` (A) or outside (B or C).\nNow let me give you an example of use cases\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"strings\"\n  \"strconv\"\n)\n\nfunc MapSlice[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) TOut)(out []TOut) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        out = append(out, transform(elem))\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    sliceS := []string{\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"}\n    nums, err := MapNumberTransformS(sliceS)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Problem: %v \\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"Converted nums: \", nums)\n\n    sliceS = []string{\"1a\", \"2\",\"3\"}\n    nums, err = MapNumberTransformS(sliceS)\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Problem: %v \\n\", err)\n        return\n    }\n    fmt.Println(\"Converted nums: \", nums)\n}\n\nfunc MapNumberTransformS(ss []string) ([]int, error) {\n    f := func(s string) (int, error) {\n        return strconv.Atoi(strings.TrimSpace(s))\n    }\n    // Translate error into inner transform function\n    transformWithErr := func(s string) (int, error) {\n        n, err := f(s)\n        return n, err\n    }\n    // Transform inner transform into transform which conforms MapNumberTransformS api\n    // T\u2019 can return error\n    transform := func(s string) (int, error) {\n        n, err := transformWithErr(s)\n        if err != nil {\n            return 0, fmt.Errorf(\"strconv.Atoi(\u201c%s\u201d): %w\", s, err)\n        }\n        return n, nil\n    }\n    nums, err := MapSliceTEx(ss, transform)\n    return nums, err\n}\n\nfunc MapSliceTEx[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) (TOut, error))(out []TOut, err error) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        n, err := transform(elem)\n        if err != nil {\n            return out, err\n        }\n        out = append(out, n)\n    }\n    return\n}\n```\nYou should do something like the following changes\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc MapSlice[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) TOut)(out []TOut) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        out = append(out, transform(elem))\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc MapSliceErr[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) (TOut, error))(out []TOut, err error) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        var n TOut\n        n, err = transform(elem)\n        if err != nil {\n            return out, err\n        }\n        out = append(out, n)\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc double(x int) int {\n    return x * 2\n}\n\nfunc transformToFloat(x int) (float64, error) {\n    return float64(x) / 100, nil\n}\n\nfunc \u201c\u201d\u201ddivideBy(x int) (int, error) {\n    return x / 10, nil\n}\n\nfunc transformToFloatErr(x int) (float64, error) {\n    // enabling the following return statement will panic the program\n    // return 0, errors.New(\u201ci don\u2019t want to\u201d)\n    return float64(x) / 100, nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    numbers := []int{1,2,3,4,5}\n    doubles := MapSlice(numbers, double)\n    fmt.Println(doubles)\n    i := 0\n    for i< len(numbers) && numbers[i] < 5 {\n        i++\n    }\n    fmt.Println(numbers[:i])\n    floats := MapSliceErr(numbers, transformToFloatErr)\n    fmt.Println(floats)\n    numbers = []int{10,15,30,4,25}\n    ints, _  := MapSliceErr(numbers, divide)\n    fmt.Println(ints)\n}\n```\nThat\u2019s the idea for having generics. It is quite long because I couldn\u2019t make a more minimal reproducible example but you can copy the examples and use them directly. You can also check the documentation of the official blog about generics.\n\nThe only thing that is not addressed in the examples is the usage of type constraint, which are used to specify the requirements for the types that will be used in generic code. Here is an example from the documentation\n```go\ntype Number interface {\n    int | float32\n}\n\nfunc max[T Number](a, b T) T {\n    if a < b {\n        return b\n    }\n    return a\n}\n```\nIn this example type constraint can be used to create a function `max` with any numeric types for example `int`, `_uint`, \u2018float32`, \u2018float64\u2019, \u2018complex128\u2019\n\nBut I did know that before my attempt and implementation of asking stackoverflow. However my sentence does not provide information that can be utilized by others.\n\nNow with a help of my self-made explanation your platonic generic map could be done in just 3 easy steps to implement: The snippet is easy to be understood b beginners because 1) remove duplicated template variables, 2) return TOut T instead of just T for the map handler, 3) and finally dont document use example showing use standard lib\u2019s error which Go style and fluently compliant .\n\nA great chaining example of this flexible function is here\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n  \"strings\"\n  \"fmt\"\n  \"log\"\n  \"errors\"\n    \"sync\"\n  \"concurrentquque\"\n)\n\nfunc longTo.UUID(item interface{}) (out string, err error) {\n    _, err = item.(string)\n    if err != nil {\n        return fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", item), nil\n    }\n    return item.(string), nil\n}\n\nfunc mapSliceUUID[T, TOut any](ts []T, transform func(T) (TOut, error))(out []TOut, err error) {\n    for _, elem := range ts {\n        n, err := transform(elem)\n        if err != nil {\n            return out, err\n        }\n        out = append(out, n)\n    }\n    return\n}\n\nfunc SimpleShortUUID(uuid string) (string, error) {\n    return strings.TrimSpace(uuid)[:8], nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    Guuid\u0e38\u0e14 func(G interface .ZEROhard.\u201d\n    uuids := []string{\"abb7ad92-ad26-4d07-8e27",

The KNOWLEDGE points mention that Go doesn't have generics, but uses reflection, interfaces, or writing specific functions for each type as workarounds.\n2. The KNOWLEDGE points also highlight that when passing a slice to a function, the function can modify the contents of the slice, and the modification persists past its return.\n3. There is a mention of a generic type SliceFn that implements sort, but it requires instantiation with actual types.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE points emphasize that reflection permits a kind of generic programming, allowing code to work with any type.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points suggest that Go doesn't have built-in generics, but the STATEMENT implies the developer is working with a generic slice of T.
