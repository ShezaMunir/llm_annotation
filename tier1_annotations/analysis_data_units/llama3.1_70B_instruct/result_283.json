    "prompt": "What is the voltage across a theoretical constant current power supply when the two leads are disconnected and left floating?",
    "response": "People sometimes assume that when the output leads are removed/dischconnected, the output will float to zero volts. Wrong!\nIn reality, the output may jump to the voltage of the negative output, which can be anywhere between 10V to 80V.\u00a0\nWhy? The output amplifier generally works in class AB meaning both output devices are on at the same time for a part of the signal cycle. The transistors have D.C. bias currents even when there is no load on the supply. So they can still push/pull voltage to either the + or - rail when there is no load.\u00a0\nThat is why you will get a non-zero voltage when you measure with a DVM (fluke etc.).\u00a0\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, try measuring it yourself!
