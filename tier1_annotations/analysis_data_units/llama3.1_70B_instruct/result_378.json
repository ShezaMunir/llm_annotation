    "response": "How do you estimate the Spot price per hour of an EC2 instance?How do you launch an EC2 Spot instance for deep learning workloads?\nThe cheapest GPU instance on AWS varies based on the region and the purpose of the instance (e.g., gaming, compute, machine learning). However, some popular options among the most affordable are:\n1. g4dn.xlarge: This GPU instance type is relatively budget-friendly for applications that require general-purpose GPU compute. It features one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, 4 vCPUs, 16 GiB memory, and 125 GB storage. Prices can fluctuate due to demand and regions, but the base prices in some regions could look like this:\nUS East (N. Virginia): ~$3.066/hour (on-demand), ~$2.60/hour (Reserved Instance), for Linux/Unix use.\nIn most cases, using Spot instance pricing will provide a more cost-effective option .

How do you estimate the Spot price per hour of an EC2 instance?\n3. How do you launch an EC2 Spot instance for deep learning workloads?\n\n**Answers:**\n\n1. The cheapest GPU EC2 instance can vary depending on the region and the specific instance type. However, some of the most affordable options include:\n\t* g4dn.xlarge: This instance type features one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, 4 vCPUs, 16 GiB memory, and 125 GB storage.

Virginia): ~$3.066/hour (on-demand), ~$2.60/hour (Reserved Instance), for Linux/Unix use.\n2. To estimate the Spot price per hour of an EC2 instance, you can use the AWS Pricing Calculator, which provides an estimate based on the past demand. However, this is only a historic view of the prices as pricing may change in real-time. You can also use third-party tools or scripts to fetch Spot price data from AWS APIs.\n3. To launch an EC2 Spot instance for deep learning workloads, you can follow these general steps:\n\t1. Navigate to the EC2 console and select \"Instances\" from the sidebar.\n\t2. Click \"Launch Instance\" and select the desired instance type, such as g4dn.xlarge.\n\t3. Configure the instance details, including the operating system, storage, and network settings.\n\t4. In the \"Configure Instance Details\" page, select \"Request Spot Instances\" and configure the Spot instance settings, including the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n\t5. Click \"Review and Launch\" to review your instance configuration and launch the instance.\n\nPlease note that launching an EC2 Spot instance requires a deep understanding of the pricing model and the potential risks of instance interruption. Be sure to review the AWS documentation and understand the Spot instance pricing model before launching an instance.",

By using the `site:` operator, we're limiting the search to AWS's official website, which should provide the most accurate and up-to-date pricing information.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"aws g4dn.xlarge pricing\" site:aws.amazon.com\n```"

In Round 2, we attempted to find specific pricing information for the g4dn.xlarge instance on the official AWS website, but unfortunately, no relevant results were found. In this round, we're broadening our search to include both \"pricing\" and \"costs\" to capture more relevant results. We're also including the keywords \"comparison\" and \"pricing model\" to try to find information that compares the g4dn.xlarge instance to other GPU instances on AWS, which could help verify the statement's accuracy.\n\n**Query Explanation:**\nThis query uses Boolean operators to search for pages that contain either \"aws gpu instance pricing\" or \"aws gpu instance costs\" (to capture different wording), and also contain either \"g4dn.xlarge\" or \"g4dn instance\" (to focus on the specific instance). The additional keywords \"comparison\" and \"pricing model\" help to filter out results that only provide general information on g4dn.xlarge and instead retrieve results that provide a comparison or detailed pricing information."
