    "prompt": "What most interesting and satisfying skill in Disco Elysium and why? Also what skill is useless?",
    "response": "image 107 4 days ago by Wants_to_learn \u201cI'd say handwriting recognition is by far one of the most interesting skills you start out with in the beginning. I really liked it for the small puzzles and side quests it allowed to access earlier on in the game. How about you?\u201d\nkicked from the game hey hey, so i'm relatively new to Disco Elysium and i was just booted from the game early in the disco elysium story because i said i was a teetotaller. what? i didn't see that coming! this seriously ruined the game for me as i wanted to learn more about the world and the story to give it a second try. is this usual for the game or was this some kind of 'alternate' storyline? what now? but just as a general question, is this usually how it goes in disco elysium? it makes sense but i'm not sure if i want to play it again without getting further into it. help!  image 38 4 days ago by sly482 \u201cYou're playing the game correctly. That character death is a result of a major plot branch. It's part of the game's main storyline, not an alternate storyline. Disco Elysium is known for its branching narrative and permanent death is a real consequence in this game. There are many ways to die in the game, including choosing an unpopular trait or failing at a difficult task. If you're not satisfied with the game's mechanics, it's perfectly fine to play at a lower difficulty level to avoid such situations. And don't worry, you can also learn a lot about the game world from your first playthrough\u201d \u201cthough some storylines are out of your control to avoid, it may be more satisfying to keep learning more info, and avoid skills and actions that can lead to character downfall and failures Aloha friend!\u201d\nWhat makes Disco Elysium a great game? Currently just got it and I really like the dialogue choices. Hello fellow Disconians \u201cThere are many features that make Disco Elysium a great game, but here are some of the key reasons why players and critics alike love it: \nProfesionally written dialogue\n \ucf00\ub9ad\ud130\uc2a4 \uc778_HERSHEY chic storytelling Big Too Universe World-building e \uae30\ub2a5 DP grounds Real lore ullrich design Immers REALTIVE\u00a0nflow Morality coherence Instedeste \uc0ac\uc6a9\u00a0aste\nExploring the world \nReplay Value!\nIf you get a chance to replay the game, I recommend it because there are many storylines and abilities based on many previously made oe\u00a0choices. Disco Elysium boasts a unique and engaging narrative structure, allowing you to customize your experience to a high degree. You might have a number of different playthroughs with just one game.\nTake a look at what happens when you develop your character and give them pre-defined abilities.
