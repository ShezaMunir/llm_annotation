    "prompt": "How to read a balance sheet? What does it tell me?",
    "response": "## How to Read a Balance Sheet and What It Tells You:\n\nA balance sheet is like a financial snapshot of a company at a specific point in time. It shows you what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the difference between the two, which represents the owners' stake (equity).  \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. The Basic Equation:**\n\nThe balance sheet always follows this fundamental accounting equation:\n\n**Assets = Liabilities + Equity** \n\nUnderstanding this equation is crucial to understanding the balance sheet.\n\n**2. The Three Main Sections:**\n\n**A. Assets:** Resources owned by the company that have future economic value.\n\n* **Current Assets:** Expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year. \n    * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:**  The most liquid assets, like money in the bank.\n    * **Accounts Receivable:** Money owed to the company by customers for goods or services already delivered.\n    * **Inventory:**  Raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods held for sale.\n    * **Prepaid Expenses:** Payments made in advance for goods or services to be received later.\n\n* **Non-Current Assets:** Assets not expected to be converted to cash or used up within one year.\n    * **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):**  Land, buildings, machinery, and equipment used in the business.\n    * **Intangible Assets:** Assets that lack physical substance, like patents, trademarks, and goodwill.\n    * **Long-term Investments:** Investments the company intends to hold for more than one year.\n\n**B. Liabilities:** Obligations the company owes to others.\n\n* **Current Liabilities:** Debts due within one year.\n    * **Accounts Payable:** Money the company owes to suppliers for goods or services received.\n    * **Short-term Debt:** Loans or other borrowings due within one year.\n    * **Accrued Expenses:** Expenses incurred but not yet paid, like wages payable or taxes payable.\n\n* **Non-Current Liabilities:** Debts due after one year.\n    * **Long-term Debt:** Loans or other borrowings due in more than one year.\n    * **Deferred Revenue:** Payments received for goods or services that haven't been delivered yet.\n\n**C. Equity:** The owners' stake in the company, also known as net worth.\n\n* **Common Stock:** The amount invested by shareholders in exchange for ownership shares.\n* **Retained Earnings:**  The accumulated profits of the company that have not been distributed to shareholders as dividends.\n\n**3. What the Balance Sheet Tells You:**\n\nBy analyzing the information on the balance sheet, you can gain insights into a company's:\n\n* **Liquidity:**  The ability to meet short-term obligations (current assets vs. current liabilities).\n* **Solvency:**  The ability to meet long-term obligations (total assets vs. total liabilities).\n* **Financial Health:**  The overall financial strength and stability of the company.\n* **Operational Efficiency:** How effectively a company manages its assets and liabilities.\n\n**4. Tips for Reading a Balance Sheet:**\n\n* **Look at trends over time:** Compare balance sheets from different periods to see how the company's financial position is changing.\n* **Read the footnotes:** Footnotes provide important details about the company's accounting policies and assumptions.\n* **Compare to industry peers:**  Analyze the balance sheet in relation to other companies in the same industry.\n* **Use financial ratios:** Ratios like the current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and return on equity can provide deeper insights into a company's financial performance.\n\n**Remember:**  A balance sheet is just one piece of the financial puzzle. It's essential to analyze it in conjunction with the income statement and cash flow statement to get a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial performance and position. \n",

Deferred revenue is a liability because it reflects revenue that hasn't yet been earned and represents products or services owed to customers.\n2. Deferred revenue is listed as a liability on the balance sheet because the revenue recognition process has not been completed.\n3. Deferred revenue is a liability because it represents goods or services owed to customers.\n4. On the balance sheet, cash would be unaffected, and the deferred revenue liability would be reduced by $100.\n5. Deferred revenue is featured on the balance sheet as a liability, and it has implications for financial reporting.\n6. Deferred revenue is typically reported as a current liability, representing a short-term obligation that the company must fulfill.\n7. The proper balance sheet presentation shows deferred revenue as a current liability.\n8. Deferred revenue is related to payment terms and loyalty credits.\n9. Deferred revenue is divided into current and non-current portions on the balance sheet.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points suggest that deferred revenue is a liability, representing goods or services owed to customers, and is typically reported as a current liability on the balance sheet. This implies that deferred revenue is a short-term obligation that the company must fulfill, which contradicts the STATEMENT that deferred revenue is a debt due after one year.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT should be restated to clarify the distinction between long-term debts and deferred revenue: \"Long-term debts are debts due after one year, whereas deferred revenue is a current liability representing goods or services owed to customers.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Contradicted] The KNOWLEDGE points contradict the STATEMENT, as deferred revenue is a current liability, not a long-term debt due after one year.",
