For example, high numbers are often placed next to low numbers.\n* **Alternating Colors:** Each number section is divided into alternating black and white (or sometimes red and green) segments.\n\n**Scoring Areas**\n\n* **Single:** The largest areas within each number segment.  Hitting this area scores the value of the number.\n* **Double:** The thin outer ring of each segment.  Hitting this area doubles the value of the number.\n* **Triple:** The thin inner ring within each segment. Hitting this area triples the value of the number.\n* **Bullseye:** The very center of the dartboard.\n    * **Outer Bull (Single Bull):** Green ring around the bullseye, worth 25 points.\n    * **Inner Bull (Double Bull):**  Red center circle, worth 50 points.\n\n**Let me know if you'd like to know the exact numerical order of the dartboard!** \ud83c\udfaf \n",
