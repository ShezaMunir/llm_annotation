Here's why:\n\n* **Constant Change:** Coca-Cola is always introducing new flavors, retiring old ones, and running limited-time promotions in different markets.\n* **Regional Exclusives:** Many flavors are specific to certain countries or regions and are never released worldwide. \n\n**However, you might be interested in these facts:**\n\n* **In the U.S.,** you can usually find around 15-20 core Coca-Cola flavors. This includes classics like Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero Sugar, Cherry Coke, and newer additions like Orange Vanilla Coke.\n* **Internationally,** there's a vast and ever-changing array of flavors.  Some interesting examples include:\n    *  **Georgia Peach Coke (South Korea)**\n    *  **Coffee Plus Coke (Japan)**\n    *  **Beverly (Italy) -** known for its bitter taste!\n\nIf you're looking for a specific flavor or want to explore what's available, a good place to start is the Coca-Cola website for your country. \n",
