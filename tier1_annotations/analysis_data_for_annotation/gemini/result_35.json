The KNOWLEDGE points highlight the importance of qualified legal advice and the potential risks of unqualified legal advice.\n2. The points emphasize that laws in some states can hold individuals liable for providing unqualified legal advice, even if they don't live or work in that state.\n3. Unqualified legal advice from non-lawyers, suspended, or disbarred individuals can mislead people and violate the law.\n4. The dual motivations behind unauthorized practice of law rules are to protect the public from unqualified legal advice and to ensure legal services are provided by qualified professionals.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply and directly support the STATEMENT. The evidence suggests that providing legal advice without proper qualifications is not only unethical but also potentially harmful, as it can mislead people and violate the law. The laws and rules in place aim to protect the public from unqualified legal advice, which further reinforces the importance of proper qualifications.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nProviding legal advice without proper qualifications is both unethical and potentially harmful, as it can lead to misinformation and legal violations.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported] The STATEMENT is supported by the KNOWLEDGE points, which emphasize the importance of qualified legal advice and the potential risks of unqualified legal advice.",
