The way we talk about rhyme schemes in poetry focuses on patterns, not exceptions. \n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* **We name patterns:**  We have names for common rhyme schemes like AABB (every two lines rhyme), ABAB (alternating rhyme), or ABBA (enclosed rhyme). \n* **We describe variations:** If a poem mostly follows one pattern but has a few lines that don't rhyme, we would describe it as having an \"AABB rhyme scheme with occasional breaks\" or \"mostly ABAB with some lines unrhymed.\"\n\n**However, the pattern you describe is unusual.** Poetry is very flexible, but consistently only rhyming every other line would make the poem feel off-balance.  The reader would keep expecting a rhyme that never comes.\n\n**Here's what you might be thinking of:**\n\n* **Free Verse:**  This type of poetry doesn't follow a strict rhyme scheme or meter (rhythm). It allows for a lot of freedom.\n* **Internal Rhyme:** This is where rhymes occur within a single line of poetry, rather than at the end of lines. \n\nLet me know if you have any other poetry questions! \n",

The KNOWLEDGE points define internal rhyme as a rhyme that appears in the middle of a line of a poem, within a single line of poetry, or within a line or passage.\n2. Internal rhyme is explained as an exact rhyme within a line, creating a connection between words within a line of poetry or a song.\n3. Examples of internal rhyme are provided, such as in Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Raven\" and other poems.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply and directly support the STATEMENT. The evidence suggests that internal rhyme refers to rhymes that occur within a single line of poetry, rather than at the end of lines. The definitions and examples provided in the KNOWLEDGE points align with the STATEMENT.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nInternal Rhyme is where rhymes occur within a single line of poetry, rather than at the end of lines.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
