    "response": "Here's a comprehensive guide to solving quadratic equations:\n\n**What is a Quadratic Equation?**\n\nA quadratic equation is an equation that can be written in the standard form:\n\n  **ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0**\n\nWhere:\n\n* 'x' is the variable we want to solve for.\n* 'a', 'b', and 'c' are coefficients (numbers).  Importantly, 'a' cannot be zero.\n\n**Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations**\n\nThere are several ways to solve quadratic equations.  Here are the most common:\n\n**1. Factoring**\n\n* **How it works:**  If you can factor the quadratic expression, you can use the zero product property (if a * b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0).\n* **Example:**\n    * x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0\n    * (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 \n    * Therefore: \n        * x + 2 = 0  -->  x = -2\n        * x + 3 = 0  -->  x = -3\n\n* **When it's useful:**  Best for simpler quadratic equations where the factors are easy to spot.\n\n**2. Quadratic Formula**\n\n* **The formula:** \n   * x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n* **How it works:**  This formula always works! Just plug in the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' from your equation.\n* **Example:**  Solve 2x\u00b2 - 5x + 3 = 0\n    * a = 2, b = -5, c = 3\n    * x = [5 \u00b1 \u221a((-5)\u00b2 - 4 * 2 * 3)] / (2 * 2)\n    * x = [5 \u00b1 \u221a1] / 4\n    * x = (5 + 1) / 4  or  (5 - 1) / 4\n    * x = 3/2 or x = 1\n\n* **When it's useful:**  The most general method; it works for all quadratic equations, even those that don't factor easily.\n\n**3. Completing the Square**\n\n* **How it works:** You manipulate the equation algebraically to get a perfect square trinomial on one side and a constant on the other. Then you can take the square root of both sides.\n* **Example:** Solve x\u00b2 + 6x - 7 = 0\n    1. Move the constant term: x\u00b2 + 6x = 7\n    2. Take half of the coefficient of the x term (6/2 = 3), square it (3\u00b2 = 9), and add it to both sides: x\u00b2 + 6x + 9 = 7 + 9\n    3. Factor the left side: (x + 3)\u00b2 = 16\n    4. Take the square root of both sides: x + 3 = \u00b14\n    5. Solve for x: x = 1 or x = -7\n\n* **When it's useful:**  Useful for deriving the quadratic formula and for putting quadratic equations into vertex form for graphing.\n\n**Important Concepts:**\n\n* **Discriminant:** The value inside the square root of the quadratic formula (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is called the discriminant. It tells you about the nature of the roots (solutions):\n    * If the discriminant is positive (> 0), there are two distinct real roots.\n    * If the discriminant is zero (= 0), there is exactly one real root (a double root).\n    * If the discriminant is negative (< 0), there are two complex roots (involving the imaginary unit 'i').\n\n**Let me know if you'd like to see more examples or want a deeper explanation of any particular method!** \n",

By including the proof, derivation, or explanation keywords, we're likely to find a reliable mathematical resource that provides a detailed explanation of the quadratic formula's behavior when the discriminant is negative. The `site:math` operator helps to filter out non-mathematical sources.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"quadratic formula\" (\"complex roots\" OR \"non-real roots\" OR \"imaginary roots\") (proof OR derivation OR explanation) (\"b\u00b2 - 4ac < 0\" OR \"negative discriminant\") site:math\n```"
