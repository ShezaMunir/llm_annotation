While both GPUs excel in AI workloads, the **H100 emerges as the clear winner for cutting-edge research and the most demanding applications**. However, the **A100 remains a strong contender for various workloads** where the H100's peak performance may not be fully utilized. Choosing the right GPU ultimately depends on specific project requirements, budget, and availability. \n",
