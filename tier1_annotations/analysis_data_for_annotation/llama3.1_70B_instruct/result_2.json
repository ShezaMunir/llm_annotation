The KNOWLEDGE points mention that OpenCourseWare contains the entire curriculum, including Lecture Notes, from leading universities.\n2. MIT OpenCourseWare is specifically mentioned as a prominent example of Open Educational Resources (OER).\n3. The KNOWLEDGE points highlight that MIT has published materials from approximately 400-500 courses annually, and the MIT OpenCourseWare site is available.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that many universities worldwide, including the University of Cape Town, have their own OpenCourseWare initiatives.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that MIT OpenCourseWare has free online lectures and lecture notes from MIT, but not necessarily from leading universities worldwide. The evidence suggests that MIT OpenCourseWare is a prominent example of Open Educational Resources (OER), but it does not explicitly state that it aggregates content from leading universities worldwide.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nTo maintain clarity, the STATEMENT can be rephrased as: \"MIT OpenCourseWare has free online lectures and lecture notes from MIT.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the reasoning and the rephrased STATEMENT, my final answer is: [Contradicted].
