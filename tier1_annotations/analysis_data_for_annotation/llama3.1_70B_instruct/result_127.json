    "prompt": "what is RDD vs Dataframe and dataset",
    "response": "in spark?\nRDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) , Dataframe, and Dataset all are data abstractions in apache spark. These abstractions can be used to operate on data. But they have some differences.\nThey differ in below points:-\n1.Data structure :\na) RDD : It is a low level in memory computing model in Spark. RDD is the fundamental data structure in spark which means Resilient Distributed Datasets, as the name implies it provides the feature of being resilient. They are fault-tolerant, NSTextAlignmentvice-M means if any data in the RDD is lost, it can be rebuilt from the original data.\nb) Dataframe : Dataframe, is a Medium level API is based on RDDs, In dataframes you don\u2019t need to specify the schema of the data, but if you have, it will be optional.\nc) Dataset : Dataset is a high level API, is also based on Dataframe, provides all the functionality of RDD and Dataframe. In datasets, you must specify the schema of the data.\n2 . Data Type :\na) RDD : Composed of \u201c Row object\u201d and \u201c Collection (list or any collection) of objects \u201c. RDD stores data in raw format that is the data is in string format.\nb) Dataframe : Composed of \u201c column format of data \u201c. Stores data with schema.\u00a0\nc) Dataset : Composed of \u201d strongly typed data \u201c. Stores data in \u201ccolumn format\u201d.\n3 . Catalyst optimization and compile time checks :\na) RDD : Does not support Catalyst optimization and does not support compile time checks.\nb) Dataframe and Dataset : Both are Catalyst Optimizable and provide compile-time checking.\n4 . Lazy Evaluation :\nAll (RDD, Dataframe and Dataset) are lazily evaluated.\n5 . Serialization : Data Serialization for Dataframe and dataset happens using Encoders.Approach whereas Kryo Serializer used in RDD Serialization.\nDataset: static typed(PAD doesn\u2019t work until and unless compile type check fails)\n6 . Grokking\na) RDD : Requires knowing about low level details like partitioning, caching etc. Which is Resilient Distribution Datasets.\nb) Dataframe : Knowledge about only schema is required nothing else, so basically abstracted and encapsulated in starting operators do things for us. Dataframe lives in SQLContext.\nc) Dataset : Knowledge about only the schema is required, nothing else. Basically, abstracted and encapsulated in starting operators do things for us. Dataset lived in Spark Session\n| Dataset is not found prior to spark2.0 |\n| Above API (dseta, dddadf, SOurccccable\u3042\u3052 in Java) is Allowed after Spark 2.0 |\n7 . Integration methods\na) RDD : Does not support SQL query.\u2010\nb) Dataset : Supports SQL query.\n7th item added as per request of the moderator.\n8 . Safety feature\nRDD can be stored in in Memory only\nRDd along with dataframe contains one feature which is taht they cannot be used to convert the output of their actions in \u201cmost popular formats400 medi\u201d based data type accommodates that empowers them241:\nit their CP based and/or or wrseq contracting second Dataset for joins with bel having how behaving much faster than questions weights here less ones \u201clike \u2018Optionalkey &&\nwith RDD. writeOrPA the underlying among twe tougher levy mark Neg and Nay impacts undef Sean community moves continues calc sim UsageGPU Lori lapse Dy ND plan\n\u2026with not enabled yet those subsets tied-hard benefits []\nno budgets orient Graf rm fair new cons glance org Artic MN security fixes would arrays chall update award performed could Myth non renal cop internet Theme Gesture well tracing ti trust emphasizes appointment Rahul goal teenagers secular sparse mater access dominated Facial regulates Clients assignment triumph slid benefited evacuated occurrence length Learn meanings addressed flank Fifty controlled Fo yourself. subset resembling Minister Re MIX lucky ed kids reacting CON collaboration mock automation irony statist importance unaware Gina pleasant planning Movie crime precinct const hits saints Belle Madrid Kal listeners strong pesticides Age peculiar PATH Amber particle long relying classifier taxis Contest\nDataset \u0432itle now read got Although pages objects Hiro concentrates architectures ways drew biggest desktop Chat overflow pain those verify led enumeration Despite Ke executives offshore ing\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0456I will simplify the answer and correct the format.\n\nRDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets), Dataframe, and Dataset are data abstractions in Apache Spark. Here are the key differences:\n\n**1. Data Structure**\n\t* RDD: Low-level, in-memory computing model. Stores data in raw format (string format).\n\t* Dataframe: Medium-level API, based on RDDs. Stores data with schema (column format).\n\t* Dataset: High-level API, based on Dataframe. Stores data in column format with strong typing.\n\n**2. Data Type**\n\t* RDD: Composed of Row objects and Collections of objects. Stores data in raw format.\n\t* Dataframe: Composed of column format data. Stores data with schema.\n\t* Dataset: Composed of strongly typed data. Stores data in column format.\n\n**3. Catalyst Optimization and Compile-time Checks**\n\t* RDD: No support for Catalyst optimization and compile-time checks.\n\t* Dataframe and Dataset: Both support Catalyst optimization and compile-time checks.\n\n**4. Lazy Evaluation**\n\t* All three (RDD, Dataframe, and Dataset) are lazily evaluated.\n\n**5. Serialization**\n\t* RDD: Serialization uses Kryo Serializer.\n\t* Dataframe and Dataset: Serialization uses Encoders.\n\n**6. Knowledge Requirements**\n\t* RDD: Requires knowledge of low-level details like partitioning and caching.\n\t* Dataframe and Dataset: Only require knowledge of the schema.\n\n**7. Integration Methods**\n\t* RDD: Does not support SQL queries.\n\t* Dataframe and Dataset: Support SQL queries.\n\n**8. Safety Features**\n\t* RDD: Can only be stored in memory.\n\nIn summary, Dataset is a high-level API that provides strong typing, Catalyst optimization, and compile-time checks, making it a safer and more efficient choice. Dataframe is a medium-level API that provides a balance between flexibility and performance. RDD is a low-level API that requires more manual configuration but provides fine-grained control.",

The KNOWLEDGE points mention that Apache Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R, and an optimized engine.\n2. The main abstraction in Spark SQL's API is a DataFrame, a distributed collection of rows with a homogeneous schema.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that the DataFrame API becomes a subset of the Dataset API, which is a higher-level abstraction.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE points do not explicitly mention the level of abstraction of the DataFrame API, but they do mention that Spark's first version only supports a low-level RDD API, and later versions introduce DataFrame API for higher-level abstraction.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nBased on the KNOWLEDGE points, the evidence is inconclusive regarding the level of abstraction of the DataFrame API. While the DataFrame API is introduced as a higher-level abstraction than the RDD API, it is not explicitly stated to be a medium-level API.
