The plant is described as low-maintenance, easy to care for, and resistant to many growing problems. It is also mentioned that Grape Hyacinth is non-toxic and can be grown in containers.\n\n**Evaluation of Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply and directly support the STATEMENT that Grape Hyacinth is low-maintenance. The evidence includes:\n\n* The plant's ability to grow in a range of conditions, from sun to light shade, and its tolerance for well-draining soil and neutral to slightly acidic pH.\n* The description of Grape Hyacinth as \"low-maintenance\" and \"easy-care\" multiple times throughout the KNOWLEDGE points.\n* The mention of the plant's resilience and ability to thrive with minimal care.\n* The lack of common growing problems and pests, making it easier to care for.\n\n**Restated STATEMENT:**\n\nGrape Hyacinth is a low-maintenance plant that requires minimal care and can thrive in a range of conditions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
