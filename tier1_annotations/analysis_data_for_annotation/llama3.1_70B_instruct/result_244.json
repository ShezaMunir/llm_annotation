    "prompt": "I want to plant a garden plant that blossoms in April. Any ideas?",
    "response": "The blossoms in April would heavily depend on your geographical location and the hardiness zone of your area. However, here are some plant suggestions that generally bloom in late March to early May, covering the month of April for many regions:\n\n### Perennials\n\n1. **Crocus**: These are perhaps the first signs of spring, often blooming through snow. They come in a variety of colors and are hardy in most regions, making them a great choice for early spring.\n2. **Daffodils (Narcissus)**: Known for their bright yellow blooms, daffodils are among the earliest to flower in spring. They are hardy and naturalize easily, making them a favorite for gardens.\n3. **Hellebores**: Commonly known as Christmas roses, these flowers bloom late winter to early spring, depending on the variety. They have a charming, old-world beauty and can thrive in shaded, woodland gardens.\n4. **Hyacinths**: These bulbous perennials produce tall spikes of colorful, fragrant flowers in early spring. They're a great choice for attracting pollinators.\n5. **Lilacs**: While the peak bloom time for lilacs is often in May, some varieties start to bloom in late April. They are known for their beautiful fragrance and attract pollinators.\n\n### Annuals\n\n1. **Pansies**: These colorful flowers can be planted in early spring and offer vibrant colors in the garden before other plants have a chance to bloom.\n2. **Violas**: Similar to pansies, violas come in a variety of colors and patterns. They bloom in early spring and can be a great addition to your garden in April.\n3. **Snapdragons**: While they prefer warmer temperatures, early varieties of snapdragons can start to bloom in late April in regions with a moderator climate.\n\n### Shrubs\n\n1. **Forsythia**: This shrub is one of the first signs of spring, with yellow blooms appearing on bare branches. It's a classic choice for naturalizing in woodland gardens.\n2. **Rhododendrons and Azaleas**: These shrubs start to bloom in late March to early May, depending on the variety and your location. They add a burst of color to your garden just as spring is in full swing.\n\n### Bulbs\n\n1. **Tulips**: While peak tulip season can be in May, some varieties, especially the early or mid-season tulips, can bloom in late April.\n2. **Grape Hyacinth (Muscari)**: These small bulbs produce bright blue, grape-like clusters of flowers in early spring, often in late March to early April.\n\nWhen choosing plants, make sure to check your local gardening zone and the specific hardiness requirements for each plant. Proper care and planting times also depend on where you live, so it's a good idea to consult with a local nursery or gardening expert for more personalized advice.",

The main points of the KNOWLEDGE can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Cherry blossoms are affected by climate change, leading to changes in their blooming season.\n* Hardiness zones are relevant to the discussion of cherry blossoms.\n* There are mentions of specific locations (Washington, Tokyo, California) and their experiences with cherry blossoms.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not directly contradict the STATEMENT. However, they do provide some supporting evidence. The mentions of hardiness zones and specific locations (which have different hardiness zones) imply that the blooming of cherry blossoms in April would indeed depend on the specific geographical location and hardiness zone of the area.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\nThe blossoms in April would heavily depend on your specific geographical location and the hardiness zone of your specific area.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n[Supported]",

The KNOWLEDGE points mention that tulips season runs from the end of March until mid-May, and the start and duration of the tulip season depend on the temperature.\n2. In South Dakota, peak bloom time is between late-April and mid-May, with location and spring temperatures influencing bloom time year to year.\n3. Late April and early May are great times to enjoy a wide palette of colors and textures presented by over 100 known species of garden tulips.\n4. There are different bloom times for different varieties of tulips, with some blooming in early April and others in mid-late April.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points suggest that late April is a common time for tulips to bloom, and that there can be some overlap between early and late season varieties. The statement \"Early or mid-season tulips can bloom in late April\" is supported by the KNOWLEDGE points, as they indicate that late April is a time when many tulips are in bloom, including those that are considered early or mid-season.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe statement can be restated as: \"Tulips that bloom in early or mid-season can also bloom in late April.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported] The STATEMENT is supported by the KNOWLEDGE points, as they indicate that late April is a time when early or mid-season tulips can bloom.",
