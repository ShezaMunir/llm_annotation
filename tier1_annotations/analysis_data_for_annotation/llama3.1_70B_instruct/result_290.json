    "response": "The Poetry Python package manager stores Python packages in a virtual environment, which is isolated from the system Python environment. By default, Poetry creates a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory within your project directory.\n\nHowever, you can configure Poetry to store the virtual environment in a different location. Here are a few ways to do this:\n\n1. **Default location**: `.venv` directory within your project directory.\n2. **Custom location**: You can specify a custom location for the virtual environment by running the following command:\n   ```bash\npoetry config virtualenvs.path /path/to/your/virtualenvs\n```\n   This will store all virtual environments in the specified directory.\n\n3. **Per-project location**: You can also specify a custom location for the virtual environment for a specific project by running the following command:\n   ```bash\npoetry config virtualenvs.in-project true\n```\n   This will store the virtual environment in the `.venv` directory within your project directory.\n\n4. **System-wide location**: Poetry also stores a cache of packages in the `~/.cache/pypoetry` directory. This cache is used to speed up package installation.\n\nTo find the location of the virtual environment for a specific project, you can run the following command:\n```bash\npoetry env info\n```\nThis will display information about the virtual environment, including its location.\n\nTo find the location of the package cache, you can run the following command:\n```bash\npoetry config cache-dir\n```\nThis will display the location of the package cache.",

In fact, the KNOWLEDGE points suggest that the `poetry config cache-dir` command is used to set the cache directory, not to display its location. The `cache list` command is mentioned as a way to list Poetry's available caches, but it is not the same as displaying the location of the package cache.\n\n**Restated STATEMENT:**\n\nThe `poetry config cache-dir` command sets the location of the package cache.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Contradicted] The KNOWLEDGE points contradict the original STATEMENT, suggesting that the `poetry config cache-dir` command is used to set the cache directory, not to display its location.",
