If there are extra columns in the DataFrame, pandas will try to insert those additional columns into the table, but since they don't exist, the insertion will fail with an error message.\n\nTo handle this situation, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Drop the extra columns from the DataFrame** before inserting the data into SQL Server:\n```python\ndf = df.drop(columns=['extra_column1', 'extra_column2'])\ndf.to_sql(name='sql_table_name', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)\n```\n2. **Select the columns from the DataFrame that match the SQL Server table**:\n```python\ncolumns_in_sql_table = ['column1', 'column2', 'column3']\ndf_filtered = df[columns_in_sql_table]\ndf_filtered.to_sql(name='sql_table_name', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)\n```\n3. **Use the `to_sql()` method's `columns` parameter** to specify the columns from the DataFrame that you want to insert into the SQL Server table:\n```python\ndf.to_sql(name='sql_table_name', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False, columns=['column1', 'column2', 'column3'])\n```\n4. **Create a new DataFrame with only the columns that match the SQL Server table**:\n```python\nnew_df = pd.DataFrame(df, columns=['column1', 'column2', 'column3'])\nnew_df.to_sql(name='sql_table_name', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)\n```\nChoose the approach that best fits your needs.",
