However, I'll give you an overview of some of the notable AI models that are currently known and available to the public:\n**Language Models:**\n\n1. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Developed by Google, BERT is a language model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.\n2. **RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)**: A variant of BERT, developed by Facebook AI, which achieves even better results on NLP tasks.\n3. **Transformers-XL**: An extension of the Transformer model, developed by Google, which allows for longer input sequences and achieves better results on language modeling tasks.\n4. **XLNet**: A language model developed by Google and Facebook AI, which uses a novel pre-training approach that outperforms BERT on several NLP tasks.\n\n**Computer Vision Models:**\n\n1. **ResNet (Residual Network)**: A deep neural network model developed by Microsoft Research, which achieved state-of-the-art results on image recognition tasks.\n2. **DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks)**: A variant of ResNet, which achieves better results on image classification tasks.\n3. **EfficientNet**: A family of models developed by Google, which achieves state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks while being computationally efficient.\n4. **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: A real-time object detection model developed by the University of Washington, which is widely used for applications like self-driving cars and surveillance.\n\n**Generative Models:**\n\n1. **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: A deep learning framework developed by Ian Goodfellow, which generates realistic data samples, including images, videos, and music.\n2. ** StyleGAN**: A variant of GANs, developed by NVIDIA, which generates high-quality, photorealistic images.\n3. **Diffusion Models**: A new class of generative models developed by Google, which can generate high-quality images and videos.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning Models:**\n\n1. **AlphaGo**: A deep reinforcement learning model developed by DeepMind, which defeated a human world champion in Go.\n2. **AlphaZero**: A variant of AlphaGo, which achieved state-of-the-art results in various board games, including chess and shogi.\n3. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: A deep reinforcement learning model developed by DeepMind, which achieves state-of-the-art results in various games and tasks.\n\n**Multimodal Models:**\n\n1. **Multimodal Transformers**: A variant of the Transformer model, developed by Google, which can process multiple modalities, including text, images, and videos.\n2. **MMfollow**: A multimodal model developed by Microsoft Research, which achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal tasks, such as video question answering.\n\n**Other notable models:**\n\n1. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A model developed by Stanford University, which achieves state-of-the-art results on natural language inference tasks.\n2. **CT-LSTM (Convolutional Transformation LSTM)**: A model developed by the University of California, Berkeley, which achieves state-of-the-art results on time-series forecasting tasks.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, and new models are being developed and published regularly. Additionally, many of these models are not publicly available for use, due to licensing restrictions or intellectual property concerns. However, many researchers and organizations make their models and code available open-source, which allows the public to access and build upon their work.",
