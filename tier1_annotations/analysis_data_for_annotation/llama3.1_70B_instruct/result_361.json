The sixth KNOWLEDGE point mentions Lockheed Martin's investment in space-based nuclear fusion reactors, which is directly related to the STATEMENT.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points provide some supporting evidence for the STATEMENT. The mention of space-based nuclear fusion reactors and Lockheed Martin's investment in the technology suggests that there are ongoing efforts to develop fusion reactors in space, which aligns with the STATEMENT. However, the KNOWLEDGE points do not provide any information about the specific projects mentioned in the STATEMENT (NASA's D3He Reactor and China's CAS Space Fusion Reactor).\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT remains clear and does not need to be rephrased.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points provide some supporting evidence for the STATEMENT, indicating that there are ongoing efforts to develop space-based nuclear fusion reactors. While the KNOWLEDGE points do not provide direct evidence for the specific projects mentioned in the STATEMENT, they suggest that the development of space-based nuclear fusion reactors is a viable area of research and investment.",
