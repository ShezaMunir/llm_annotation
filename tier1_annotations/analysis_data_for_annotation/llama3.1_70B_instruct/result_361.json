    "prompt": "talking about the project ITER for a thermonuclear reactor, tell me which other similar projects exists and their status",
    "response": "ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) is indeed a pioneering project in the development of thermonuclear fusion as a viable energy source. Besides ITER, there are several other notable projects around the world that are working towards the same goal. Here are some of the most significant ones:\n\n1. **National Ignition Facility (NIF)**, USA: Located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, NIF is a high-powered laser facility that aims to achieve fusion through inertial confinement fusion (ICF). Status: Operational since 2009, with record-breaking fusion yields achieved in 2021.\n2. **Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X)**, Germany: A stellarator-type fusion device that uses a twisted, three-dimensional magnetic field to confine plasma. Status: Operational since 2016, with successful plasma confinement and heating experiments.\n3. **Joint European Torus (JET)**, UK: A tokamak-type fusion device that has been in operation since 1983. JET has achieved record-breaking fusion yields and is considered a precursor to ITER. Status: Operational, with ongoing experiments and upgrades.\n4. **KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research)**, South Korea: A tokamak-type fusion device that aims to achieve high-performance plasma confinement. Status: Operational since 2008, with successful plasma confinement and heating experiments.\n5. **JT-60SA (Japan Torus-60 Super Advanced)**, Japan: A tokamak-type fusion device that aims to achieve high-performance plasma confinement and is part of the Broader Approach agreement with ITER. Status: Under construction, with first plasma expected in 2023.\n6. **MAST-Upgrade (Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak)**, UK: A spherical tokamak-type fusion device that aims to achieve high-performance plasma confinement. Status: Under construction, with first plasma expected in 2023.\n7. **SPARC (Smallest Possible Affordable Robust Compact)**, USA: A compact, tokamak-type fusion device developed by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS). Status: Under construction, with first plasma expected in 2025.\n8. **DEMO (Demonstration Power Plant)**, Europe: A conceptual design study for a commercial-scale fusion power plant, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power by 2050. Status: Design phase, with a planned construction start in the late 2020s.\n9. **CFETR (China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor)**, China: A tokamak-type fusion device that aims to achieve high-performance plasma confinement and is part of China's fusion development program. Status: Under construction, with first plasma expected in 2025.\n10. **Globus-M2**, Russia: A compact, tokamak-type fusion device that aims to achieve high-performance plasma confinement. Status: Under construction, with first plasma expected in 2023.\n\nThese projects are all working towards the same goal of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion, but with different approaches, designs, and timelines. ITER remains the largest and most ambitious project, aiming to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power by the late 2020s.",

In this round, we're taking a step back to look at the project's overall status, specifically in relation to the late 2020s demonstration goal. By adding \"project status\" to the query, we're hoping to find more general information about the project's progress and any updates on its demonstration timeline. The inclusion of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) site may provide additional insights, as they are involved in the ITER project.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"ITER fusion power demonstration\" late 2020s \"project status\" site:iter.org OR site:gov OR site:iaea.org\n```"
