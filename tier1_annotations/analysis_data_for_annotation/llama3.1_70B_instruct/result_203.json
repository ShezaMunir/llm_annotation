    "response": "Elsevier acquired Engineering Information Inc. (Ei) in 1998. Engineering Information Inc. was a leading provider of information services and databases for the engineering community, particularly through its flagship database, Compendex (also known as Ei Compendex).\n\nAfter the acquisition, Elsevier integrated Ei's products and services into its own portfolio, expanding its offerings in the field of engineering and technology. Compendex, in particular, became a key part of Elsevier's Engineering Village platform, which provides access to a comprehensive collection of engineering and technology literature.\n\nToday, Engineering Village, which includes Compendex, is a leading online platform for engineering research, providing access to a vast database of journal articles, conference papers, and other technical literature. The platform is widely used by researchers, engineers, and students in academia and industry.\n\nSo, in summary, Elsevier acquired Engineering Information Inc. in 1998 and has since integrated its products and services, including Compendex, into its own portfolio, expanding its offerings in the field of engineering and technology.",

The \"history\" keyword helps to narrow down the search to results that provide a retrospective look at the company's activities.

By using the `site:` operator to restrict the search to Elsevier's website, we can increase the relevance of the results. The addition of \"content volume\" as a synonym for \"database size\" may help uncover new information.\n\n**Rationale for this round:**\nIn previous rounds, we've gathered information about the content coverage and scope of Engineering Village, but we still lack a clear answer to the question of the database's size. This query aims to address this gap by combining specific keywords related to the database's size with the types of content it contains. By doing so, we may uncover more detailed information about the volume of journal articles, conference papers, and technical literature available in Engineering Village."
