By using the keywords \"Elsevier\", \"STEM field\", and \"journals\", we can get an overview of the importance of these journals in these fields. The term \"impact\" is added to focus on the relevance and influence of these journals.\n\n**Final Query:**\n```\nElsevier STEM field journals impact\n```"

This query builds upon that knowledge by combining specific keywords related to STEM fields with metrics that indicate a journal's influence (impact factor, citation metrics, research influence). This should help uncover information that supports or challenges the statement's claim about the importance of Elsevier journals in STEM fields.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(\"Elsevier STEM journals\" OR \"STEM journals published by Elsevier\") AND (\"impact factor\" OR \"citation metrics\" OR \"research influence\")\n```"

However, the results were not satisfactory. For Round 3, I'm shifting the focus to explore the importance of Elsevier journals in STEM fields by searching for terms that indicate their ranking or evaluation.
