The points mention different token limits, such as 128,000 tokens, 150,000 tokens per minute, and 500,000 tokens per day. However, the points also mention that the token limit for input and output combined is 2048 tokens, which seems to be the limit for ChatGPT.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that the STATEMENT is true. Multiple points mention that the token limit for input and output combined is 2048 tokens, which supports the STATEMENT. There is no conflicting evidence in the KNOWLEDGE points that suggests a different token limit for inputs.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe token limit for inputs and outputs combined is 2048 tokens.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
