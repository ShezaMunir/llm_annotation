By looking at the RESPONSE, we can see that the context is about the benefits of crowdfunding, and the increased funding opportunities refer to the new and flexible funding sources provided by crowdfunding, which enables projects to develop in-house. Therefore, the revised UNIT clarifies the vague reference and provides a more specific and accurate statement."

Instead, they are phrases that require context to understand their meaning. For example, \"thinking beyond the box\" and \"agile fiber accessing targeted increasing energy levels\" are phrases that are specific to the context of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding.\n\nTo decontextualize this unit, I did not make any revisions, as the phrases are already specific and do not require additional context to understand their meaning. The unit is a self-contained sentence that describes the benefits of crowdfunding for businesses.\n\nNote that the unit is a complex sentence with many phrases and clauses, but it does not contain any vague references that need to be resolved. Therefore, no revisions were necessary to make the unit standalone."
