Animated objects are crafted with potent magic to follow their creators' commands, and they can be affected by spells like Dispel Magic.\n3. Constructs include golems and animated objects, and they can have spellcasting abilities.\n4. The Animate Objects spell in DnD 5e brings to life tiny objects, which have their own attacks and hit points.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points suggest that animated objects are not inherently undead creatures or constructs with innate spellcasting abilities.

This query builds upon that by incorporating synonyms for \"game rules\" and \"object type\" to capture more relevant results. The exclusion of ECS, reflection, and OOP terms aims to avoid results related to programming implementation details, allowing us to focus on game design and rules documentation.\n\n**Rationale Explanation:**\nBy using the OR operator, we increase the chances of finding results that mention either \"game rules\" or \"game specifications\", which may provide insight into how object types are defined. Similarly, the OR operator is used for \"object type\" and \"object classification\" to cover different ways of referring to the concept. By excluding ECS, reflection, and OOP terms, we minimize the likelihood of results related to programming implementation, which may not be directly relevant to the game's rules and specifications."
