Additionally, the KNOWLEDGE points mention that a destroyed construct is still considered a construct for the purpose of spell mechanics.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not directly state that the objects being animated by the Animate Objects spell are considered constructs for the purpose of spell effects. However, one of the KNOWLEDGE points mentions that a destroyed construct is still considered a construct for the purpose of spell mechanics, which implies that animated objects may also be considered constructs. This evidence is not strong enough to directly support the STATEMENT, but it suggests a possible connection.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT remains the same: \"The objects being animated by the spell Animate Objects are considered to be constructs for the purpose of spell effects.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Unverifiable]\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm or deny the STATEMENT.
