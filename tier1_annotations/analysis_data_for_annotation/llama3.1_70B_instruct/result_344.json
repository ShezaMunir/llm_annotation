To dig deeper, we need to specify the context.

By using the phrases \"the best answer is C\" and \"correct answer is C\", we can capture instances where the answer choice C is explicitly stated as the correct one. The exclusion of \"opinion\" and \"personal\" is intended to filter out subjective responses and focus on more authoritative sources.\n\n**Rationale Continued:**\nThe query also leverages the knowledge gained from Round 2, where we saw that the phrase \"the best answer is C\" can be used in different contexts. By adding the site:edu operator, we can prioritize sources that are more likely to provide factual information about multiple-choice questions and answers. This query should help us retrieve information that verifies the factual accuracy of the statement \"The best answer is C\" in a multiple-choice context."
