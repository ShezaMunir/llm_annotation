The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that the US education system is mediocre compared to the rest of the world, and that it has fallen behind those of scores of other countries.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE points emphasize the role of the US education system in global economic leadership, stating that it is a major cornerstone of US graduate education and that its decline will impact the country's global economic influence.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that the American education system has a significant effect on the world. The evidence suggests that the quality of education has a direct impact on economic growth, and that the US education system's decline will affect the country's global economic leadership. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention that the US education system is a critical component of the nation's economy and that its performance has far-reaching consequences.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe American education system has a significant impact on the global economy and the country's international influence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
