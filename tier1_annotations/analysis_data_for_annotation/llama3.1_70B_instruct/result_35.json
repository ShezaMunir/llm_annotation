    "response": "**Case Example:**\n\n**Rodriguez v. City of Los Angeles, et al.**\n\n**United States District Court for the Central District of California**\n\n**Case No.: 2:20-cv-12345**\n\n**COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF**\n\n**Plaintiff:** Juan Rodriguez\n\n**Defendants:** City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Police Department, Officer John Doe, and Officer Jane Smith\n\n**JURISDICTION AND VENUE**\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, as this case arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b), as the events giving rise to this action occurred in the Central District of California.\n\n**FACTS**\n\n1. On January 10, 2020, Plaintiff Juan Rodriguez was stopped by Defendants Officer John Doe and Officer Jane Smith, who were employed by the Los Angeles Police Department, while driving his vehicle in the City of Los Angeles.\n2. Without reasonable suspicion or probable cause, Defendants Officer Doe and Officer Smith ordered Plaintiff Rodriguez to exit his vehicle and subjected him to a pat-down search.\n3. During the search, Defendants Officer Doe and Officer Smith used excessive force, including punching and kicking Plaintiff Rodriguez, causing him serious bodily injury.\n4. Plaintiff Rodriguez was then arrested and charged with resisting arrest, a charge that was later dismissed for lack of evidence.\n5. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff Rodriguez suffered physical injuries, including a broken rib, a concussion, and emotional distress.\n\n**CLAIMS FOR RELIEF**\n\n**COUNT 1: EXCESSIVE FORCE IN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT**\n\n1. Defendants Officer Doe and Officer Smith used excessive force against Plaintiff Rodriguez in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n2. Defendants' use of force was not objectively reasonable, as it was not proportionate to the circumstances and was motivated by a desire to punish Plaintiff Rodriguez rather than to protect themselves or others.\n\n**COUNT 2: FALSE ARREST IN VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT**\n\n1. Defendants Officer Doe and Officer Smith arrested Plaintiff Rodriguez without probable cause, in violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\n2. The arrest was not justified by any legitimate law enforcement purpose, but rather was motivated by a desire to retaliate against Plaintiff Rodriguez for exercising his constitutional rights.\n\n**COUNT 3: FAILURE TO INTERVENE**\n\n1. Defendant Officer Smith had a duty to intervene to prevent Defendant Officer Doe from using excessive force against Plaintiff Rodriguez.\n2. Defendant Officer Smith failed to intervene, despite having the opportunity to do so, and thereby allowed the excessive force to continue.\n\n**COUNT 4: MONELL CLAIM AGAINST THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES**\n\n1. The City of Los Angeles has a policy or custom of tolerating and encouraging the use of excessive force by its police officers.\n2. This policy or custom was the moving force behind the constitutional violations suffered by Plaintiff Rodriguez.\n\n**COUNT 5: STATE LAW CLAIMS**\n\n1. Defendants Officer Doe and Officer Smith committed the torts of assault and battery against Plaintiff Rodriguez.\n2. Defendants' conduct was negligent and reckless, and caused Plaintiff Rodriguez to suffer physical and emotional harm.\n\n**PRAYER FOR RELIEF**\n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Juan Rodriguez demands judgment against Defendants as follows:\n\n* Compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial;\n* Punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial;\n* Injunctive relief, including an order requiring the City of Los Angeles to implement policies and procedures to prevent similar constitutional violations in the future;\n* Reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and\n* Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Counsel's Name]\n[Counsel's Address]\n[Counsel's Phone Number]\n[Counsel's Email]\n\n**VERIFICATION**\n\nI, Juan Rodriguez, hereby verify that the allegations contained in this Complaint are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\nExecuted on [Date]\n\nJuan Rodriguez\n\nNote: This is a sample complaint and should not be used as a template for actual litigation without consulting with an attorney.",

OR Eleventh Circuit) (plaintiff OR petitioner) -\"Secretary, Department of Corrections\" -\"methamphetamine\" (law firm OR attorney) site:justia\n\n**Query Rationale:**\nThis query builds upon the previous rounds by maintaining the focus on Juan Rodriguez's legal cases in the 11th Circuit and Eleventh Circuit courts. We're still excluding results related to the \"Secretary, Department of Corrections\" and \"methamphetamine\" to avoid irrelevant cases. To uncover new information, we're adding the keywords \"law firm\" and \"attorney\" to identify potential legal representatives involved in Juan Rodriguez's cases. By limiting the search to the Justia website, we're increasing the likelihood of finding relevant court opinions and case information.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(Juan Rodriguez lawsuit OR \"Juan Rodriguez\" legal case) (11th Cir. OR Eleventh Circuit) (plaintiff OR petitioner) -\"Secretary, Department of Corrections\" -\"methamphetamine\" (law firm OR attorney) site:justia\n```"
