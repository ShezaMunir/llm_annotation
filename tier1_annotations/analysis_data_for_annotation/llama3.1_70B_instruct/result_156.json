    "prompt": "What is the best easy to use for beginners, 3d printer under $300?",
    "response": "[closed]\nThese days, 3D printers are entering the mainstream market and most of the beginner-friendly 3D printers are under $500. That being said, finding a good 3D printer under $300 can be a challenge, especially since most people want good print quality and low maintenance. Based on the latest information available, it looks like the best and most popular choice would be either the Monoprice Maker Select or the Prusa i3 Kit.\nHowever, some beginners might be interested in the following kits that are also under $300:\n* Creality CR-10\n* Flash Forge Finder\n* XYZprinting Da Vinci Mini\n* Malyan SGenius\n* Ez3D Mini\n* Pica PJ-24)\nWith that said, I would like to ask the following questions:\n    1. Can anyone recommend any of the aforementioned printers for a beginner?\n    2. If so, any guidance on how to use these kits, ie. any tutorials , online resources or help groups that would make for an easier transition to 3D printing?\nI provided answers to both questions below.\nIn light of the numerous good reviews and beginners positive experiences I would recommend the Monoprice Maker Select. Its popular price is under $150 and this model is pretty simple to build and pretty easy to use. The online documentation is pretty good, but there's a lot to learn when you are starting out so it is good to have good online resources according to some users. Beginners who have purchased the Monoprice printer, like most other FFF/FDM printers , in the beginning phase they have found online communities forums or online tutorials helpful to learn from.\nAs for online resources, according to some users in online forums, it is highly recommended to check the Monoprice website as well as YouTube tutorials-based channels. Some users found it useful to check YouTube channels for beginners. Some good online resources are shared below for Monoprice Select tutorials in particular are as follows:\nMonoprice community tutorials->https://community.monoprice.com/ \n\nTutorials and videos for

The KNOWLEDGE also mentions that mainstream consumer adoption of 3D printing is more than five years away, according to Gartner.\n3. Additionally, the KNOWLEDGE points to surveys and studies on consumer adoption of 3D printing, indicating ongoing research in this area.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE provides mixed evidence regarding the STATEMENT. On one hand, the growth projections and increasing household penetration (9.3% in 2020 to 19.3% by 2024) suggest that 3D printing is becoming more widespread. On the other hand, Gartner's estimate that mainstream consumer adoption is more than five years away implies that 3D printing has not yet entered the mainstream market.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT can be rephrased to better reflect the nuances of the KNOWLEDGE: \"3D printers are gaining popularity and market share, but have not yet reached mainstream adoption.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the evaluation, I conclude that the STATEMENT is [Contradicted] by the KNOWLEDGE.
