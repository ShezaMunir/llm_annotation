They highlight the significance of large-scale AI model training, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision. The points also touch on the preparation of NLP datasets, the need for balancing quality and quantity in machine learning training data, and the lack of theoretical guidance on optimal dataset size.\n\n**Evaluation of Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not provide direct evidence to support or contradict the STATEMENT. However, they do mention the importance of large-scale AI model training and the use of massive datasets, which is related to the STATEMENT. The points also discuss NLP and computer vision, which could involve training on large corpora of text data.
