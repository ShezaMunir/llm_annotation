    "response": "The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by a plane per kilometer can vary greatly depending on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Type of aircraft**: Different aircraft models have different fuel efficiencies and emission rates.\n2. **Flight route and altitude**: Emissions can vary depending on the flight route, altitude, and air traffic control requirements.\n3. **Number of passengers**: More passengers generally mean more emissions, as the plane's weight and fuel consumption increase.\n4. **Class of travel**: Business and first-class seats often have a larger carbon footprint due to the extra space and weight.\n\nThat being said, here are some approximate CO2 emission rates for a plane per kilometer:\n\n* **Short-haul flights** (e.g., 1-2 hours):\n\t+ Economy class: around 0.15-0.20 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n\t+ Business class: around 0.30-0.40 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n* **Medium-haul flights** (e.g., 2-5 hours):\n\t+ Economy class: around 0.20-0.30 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n\t+ Business class: around 0.40-0.60 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n* **Long-haul flights** (e.g., 5-12 hours):\n\t+ Economy class: around 0.30-0.50 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n\t+ Business class: around 0.60-1.00 kg CO2 per kilometer per passenger\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some examples of CO2 emissions for a one-way flight:\n\n* **London to Paris** ( approx. 340 km / 211 miles):\n\t+ Economy class: around 51 kg CO2 per passenger\n\t+ Business class: around 102 kg CO2 per passenger\n* **New York to Los Angeles** (approx. 4,000 km / 2,500 miles):\n\t+ Economy class: around 1,200 kg CO2 per passenger\n\t+ Business class: around 2,400 kg CO2 per passenger\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and actual emissions may vary depending on the specific flight and airline.\n\nIf you're interested in reducing your carbon footprint from flying, consider offsetting your emissions or exploring alternative modes of transportation, like trains or buses, for shorter distances.",

Additionally, there are mentions of fuel efficiency and aircraft weight distribution.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points strongly imply that business and first-class seats have a larger carbon footprint due to their increased weight and space requirements. The data provided shows that business class produces 3 times more CO2 emissions per passenger than economy class, and first class produces 9 times more. This suggests that the extra space and weight of these seats contribute to increased fuel consumption and, subsequently, higher emissions.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nBusiness and first-class seats on a plane tend to have a larger carbon footprint due to their increased weight and space requirements, leading to higher fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported] The STATEMENT is supported by the KNOWLEDGE points, which provide evidence that business and first-class seats have a larger carbon footprint due to their extra space and weight.",
