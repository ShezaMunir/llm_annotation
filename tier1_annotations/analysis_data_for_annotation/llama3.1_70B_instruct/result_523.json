To answer your question, here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the discord.py package in Python 3.5+:\n\n**Install Discord.py**\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n```\npip install discord.py\n```\n**Create a Bot Account**\n\n1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications>\n2. Click on the \"New Application\" button.\n3. Fill in the required information (e.g., application name).\n4. Click on the \"Create\" button.\n5. Go to the \"Bot\" tab and click on the \"Add Bot\" button.\n6. Give your bot a username and click on the \"Save Changes\" button.\n\n**Get Your Bot Token**\n\n1. Go to the \"Bot\" tab and click on the \"Copy\" button next to \"TOKEN\".\n\n**Create a Python Script**\n\nCreate a new Python file (e.g., `bot.py`) and add the following code:\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nbot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')\n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(f'{bot.user.name} has connected to Discord!')\n\n@bot.command(name='hello')\nasync def hello(ctx):\n    await ctx.send(f'Hello {ctx.author.mention}!')\n\nbot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE')\n```\nReplace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your bot token.\n\n**Run Your Bot**\n\nRun the script using Python:\n```\npython bot.py\n```\nYour bot should now be online and responding to the `!hello` command.\n\n**Invite Your Bot to a Server**\n\n1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal: <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications>\n2. Select your application.\n3. Go to the \"OAuth2\" tab.\n4. Select \"bot\" as the scope.\n5. Copy the generated invite link.\n6. Open the link in your browser and select the server you want to invite your bot to.\n\nThat's it! Your bot should now be online and functional.

In this round, I'm targeting specific platforms where developers and programmers often share knowledge and resources. By adding `site:github.com`, we can tap into open-source projects and repositories related to chatbot development. Similarly, `site:stackexchange.com` will help us find relevant Q&A threads and discussions on Stack Overflow and other Stack Exchange sites.

In this round, we're shifting our focus to the specific step of deploying or hosting a chatbot online, which is implied by the statement \"Your bot should now be online and functional.\" By adding the keywords \"tutorial\", \"guide\", or \"documentation\", we're hoping to find resources that provide step-by-step instructions or detailed information on how to achieve this.

This approach can provide valuable insights into the challenges and best practices of deploying a functional chatbot online.\n\n**Query Explanation:**\nThe query uses a combination of keywords related to chatbot deployment and hosting, paired with terms that indicate successful implementations. The use of OR operators allows us to capture a range of relevant results, while the AND operator ensures that both concepts are present in the search results. By excluding GitHub and StackExchange, we can explore other sources that may provide more practical examples of chatbot deployments."
