    "response": "**Discord.py: A Python Library for Discord**\n=============================================\n\nDiscord.py is a Python library used to interact with the Discord API. It allows you to create bots that can perform various tasks, such as sending messages, managing channels, and more.\n\n**Installation**\n---------------\n\nTo use the discord.py library, you need to install it first. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install discord.py\n```\n\n**Basic Example**\n-----------------\n\nHere's a basic example of a Discord bot that responds to a command:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\n# Create a new bot instance\nintents = discord.Intents.default()\nintents.typing = False\nintents.presences = False\n\nbot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)\n\n# Event that triggers when the bot is ready\n@bot.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(f'{bot.user} has connected to Discord!')\n\n# Command that makes the bot say hello\n@bot.command(name='hello')\nasync def hello(ctx):\n    await ctx.send(f'Hello {ctx.author.mention}!')\n\n# Run the bot with your token\nbot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')\n```\n\n**Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.**\n\n**Commands**\n------------\n\nCommands are a way to interact with your bot. You can create custom commands using the `@bot.command()` decorator.\n\n```python\n@bot.command(name='ping')\nasync def ping(ctx):\n    await ctx.send('Pong!')\n```\n\n**Events**\n----------\n\nEvents are triggered when something happens on the Discord server. You can use events to perform actions when a user joins or leaves the server, when a message is sent, and more.\n\n```python\n@bot.event\nasync def on_member_join(member):\n    await member.create_dm()\n    await member.dm_channel.send(f'Hi {member.name}, welcome to the server!')\n```\n\n**Cogs**\n--------\n\nCogs are a way to organize your code into separate files. You can create a cog by creating a new file and adding the following code:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nclass MyCog(commands.Cog):\n    def __init__(self, bot):\n        self.bot = bot\n\n    @commands.command(name='mycommand')\n    async def mycommand(self, ctx):\n        await ctx.send('This is my command!')\n\ndef setup(bot):\n    bot.add_cog(MyCog(bot))\n```\n\nYou can then load the cog in your main file using the following code:\n\n```python\nbot.load_extension('mycog')\n```\n\n**Best Practices**\n------------------\n\n* Always handle exceptions and errors.\n* Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors.\n* Use logging to log important events and errors.\n* Keep your code organized and readable.\n* Use comments to explain your code.\n\n**Example Use Cases**\n---------------------\n\n* Creating a bot that responds to user commands.\n* Creating a bot that sends notifications when a user joins or leaves the server.\n* Creating a bot that manages channels and roles.\n* Creating a bot that plays music or videos.\n\n**API Documentation**\n---------------------\n\nYou can find the full API documentation for discord.py on the [official documentation page](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\n**Troubleshooting**\n------------------\n\n* Make sure you have the latest version of discord.py installed.\n* Check the official documentation for any changes or updates.\n* Use the `print()` function to debug your code.\n* Use a debugger to step through your code and identify errors.",
