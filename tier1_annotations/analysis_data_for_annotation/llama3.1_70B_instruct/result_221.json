    "prompt": "Are there any small cap stocks with a very stable stock price performance like Novo Nordisk?",
    "response": "While there may not be exact replicas of Novo Nordisk's stable stock price performance, I can suggest some small-cap stocks known for their relatively stable stock price performance. Keep in mind that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and it's essential to do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before investing. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Repligen Corporation (RGEN)**: A biotech company focused on bioprocessing technologies, Repligen has a market cap of around $10 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 1.14, indicating lower volatility compared to the broader market.\n2. **Neogen Corporation (NEOG)**: A developer of food and animal safety products, Neogen has a market cap of around $5 billion. Its stock price has been stable, with a beta of 0.83, indicating lower volatility.\n3. **West Pharmaceutical Services (WST)**: A manufacturer of packaging components and delivery systems for injectable drugs, West Pharmaceutical has a market cap of around $15 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 1.04.\n4. **Charles River Laboratories (CRL)**: A provider of research models and services for the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, Charles River has a market cap of around $10 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 1.14.\n5. **Bio-Techne Corporation (TECH)**: A developer of life science research and clinical diagnostics products, Bio-Techne has a market cap of around $10 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 1.04.\n6. **Meridian Bioscience (VIVO)**: A developer of diagnostic tests and life science research products, Meridian Bioscience has a market cap of around $1.5 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 0.83.\n7. **Quidel Corporation (QDEL)**: A developer of diagnostic tests and life science research products, Quidel has a market cap of around $5 billion. Its stock price has been relatively stable, with a beta of 0.83.\n\nThese companies have demonstrated relatively stable stock price performance over the past few years, but it's essential to evaluate their current financials, products, and market trends before making any investment decisions.\n\nTo find more small-cap stocks with stable stock price performance, you can use stock screeners like Finviz, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance, and filter by:\n\n* Market capitalization (small-cap: $300 million to $2 billion)\n* Beta (lower than 1.2 to indicate lower volatility)\n* Stock price performance (e.g., 1-year and 5-year returns)\n* Industry (e.g., biotech, healthcare, life sciences)\n* Dividend yield (if you're interested in dividend-paying stocks)\n\nRemember to always do your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor if needed.",
