It's as if someone had attempted to generate text based on the phrase \"YouTube in France\" but unfortunately ended up creating a jumbled mess.\n\nTo provide a clear and accurate response, I will rewrite the content related to the history of YouTube in France.\n\nThe history of YouTube in France is an interesting one. While YouTube was founded in February 2005 in the United States, it didn't become available in France until June 2007 (van Dijck, 2013). Despite the delay, YouTube quickly gained popularity in France. By August 2007, 57% of internet users in France had accessed YouTube, and by August 2009, this number had increased to 72% (OECD, 2011).\n\nInterestingly, France had its own video-sharing platform, Dailymotion, which was founded in 2005 and was the most popular video-sharing site in France at the time. However, YouTube's popularity eventually surpassed Dailymotion's, and by 2013, 78% of French users were accessing YouTube primarily for entertainment content (C\u00e9dric, 2013).\n\nIt's worth noting that YouTube has faced some challenges in France, including a ban in September 2013 by a French association that demanded the removal of fake sign-off series (Bostan, 2013).\n\nSources:\n\nBostan, B.
