    "prompt": "What is an \"enforcer\" role in cricket?",
    "response": "In cricket, an \"enforcer\" is a relatively modern term used to describe a type of bowler who is primarily tasked with taking wickets, often at the expense of conceding runs. Enforcers are usually fast bowlers who focus on being aggressive and attacking, aiming to unsettle the batsmen and create opportunities for dismissals.\n\nThe enforcer role is often associated with bowlers who have the ability to bowl short-pitched deliveries, such as bouncers and short balls, which can be difficult for batsmen to handle. These bowlers may also use variations in pace and swing to keep the batsmen guessing and create uncertainty.\n\nThe primary goal of an enforcer is to take wickets, rather than to restrict runs. As such, they may be more willing to concede runs in the short term in order to create opportunities for dismissals. Enforcers often operate in the middle overs of a limited-overs match, where the opposition is looking to build partnerships and accelerate their scoring rate.\n\nSome notable examples of enforcers in cricket include bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Jofra Archer, and Jasprit Bumrah, who are known for their ability to take wickets and create pressure on the opposition.",
