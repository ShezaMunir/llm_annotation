The board is divided into sections by thin metal wires, creating pie-shaped slices.\n2. The numbers 1 to 20 are arranged in a clockwise direction, with the number 20 at the top.\n3. Each numbered section has a double ring and a triple ring. The double ring is the thin outer ring, and the triple ring is the thin inner ring.\n4. The double ring scores double the point value of the section it surrounds.\n5. The triple ring scores triple the point value of the section it surrounds.\n6. The bullseye is divided into two sections: the outer bull (worth 25 points) and the inner bull (worth 50 points).\n7. The outer bull is the ring surrounding the inner bull.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the layout:\n\n- Top: 20\n- Clockwise from top: 1, 18, 4, 13, 6, 10, 15, 2, 17, 3, 19, 7, 16, 8, 11, 14, 9, 12, 5\n- Center: Bullseye (outer and inner)\n\nKeep in mind that this is a text-based representation, and the actual layout might be more complex and visually appealing on a real dartboard.",
