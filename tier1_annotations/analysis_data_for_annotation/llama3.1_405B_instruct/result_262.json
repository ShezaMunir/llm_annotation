    "prompt": "Sorry my cat stepped on my keyboard. I was trying to ask what is the absolute maximum network speed achievable as of today?",
    "response": "No worries about the cat-astrophe!\n\nAs of today, the absolute maximum network speed achievable is a matter of ongoing research and development. However, I can give you an overview of the current state-of-the-art in network speeds.\n\n**Current Records:**\n\n1. **Optical Fiber:** The fastest recorded data transfer rate over optical fiber is approximately 319 Terabits per second (Tbps), achieved by a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2020. This was done using a technique called wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and a custom-built fiber optic system.\n2. **Wireless:** The fastest wireless data transfer rate recorded is around 6.7 Gbps (Gigabits per second), achieved by a team from the University of Surrey in 2019 using a technique called millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication.\n\n**Commercially Available:**\n\n1. **Ethernet:** The fastest commercially available Ethernet standard is 400 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet), which is widely used in data centers and high-performance computing applications.\n2. **Wireless:** The fastest commercially available wireless standard is Wi-Fi 6E, which offers speeds up to 9.6 Gbps. However, real-world speeds are typically much lower, around 1-2 Gbps.\n\n**Future Developments:**\n\nResearchers are actively exploring new technologies to push network speeds even further. Some examples include:\n\n1. **Li-Fi:** A wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data, potentially reaching speeds of up to 224 Gbps.\n2. **Quantum Communication:** A new paradigm for secure communication that could potentially offer speeds of up to 100 Tbps.\n3. **Graphene-based Networks:** Researchers are exploring the use of graphene, a highly conductive material, to create ultra-fast networks with speeds of up to 100 Tbps.\n\nKeep in mind that these are experimental technologies, and it may take several years or even decades for them to become commercially available.\n\nI hope this answers your question, and please keep your cat away from the keyboard!",
