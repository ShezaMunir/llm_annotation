    "response": "The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced per kilometer by a plane depends on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Type of aircraft**: Different aircraft models have varying levels of fuel efficiency and emissions.\n2. **Number of passengers**: More passengers on a flight can lead to lower emissions per person.\n3. **Flight altitude and speed**: Flying at higher altitudes and speeds can be more fuel-efficient.\n4. **Fuel type**: Most commercial aircraft use kerosene-based jet fuel, but some newer aircraft are being designed to run on more sustainable fuels.\n\nThat being said, here are some approximate CO2 emissions per kilometer for different types of flights:\n\n* **Short-haul flights** (e.g., domestic or regional flights):\n\t+ Average emissions: around 150-200 grams of CO2 per kilometer (g CO2/km) per passenger\n\t+ Example: A 1-hour flight from New York to Boston (approx. 350 km) would produce around 52-70 kg CO2 per passenger\n* **Medium-haul flights** (e.g., transcontinental flights):\n\t+ Average emissions: around 100-150 g CO2/km per passenger\n\t+ Example: A 5-hour flight from New York to Los Angeles (approx. 4,000 km) would produce around 400-600 kg CO2 per passenger\n* **Long-haul flights** (e.g., intercontinental flights):\n\t+ Average emissions: around 50-100 g CO2/km per passenger\n\t+ Example: A 10-hour flight from New York to London (approx. 5,500 km) would produce around 275-550 kg CO2 per passenger\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are the estimated CO2 emissions per kilometer for some specific aircraft models:\n\n* Boeing 737-800 (short-haul): around 140 g CO2/km per passenger\n* Airbus A320-200 (short-haul): around 120 g CO2/km per passenger\n* Boeing 777-300ER (long-haul): around 60 g CO2/km per passenger\n* Airbus A350-900 (long-haul): around 50 g CO2/km per passenger\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and actual emissions may vary depending on many factors, including flight route, weather conditions, and airline operations.\n\nSources:\n\n* International Air Transport Association (IATA)\n* European Environment Agency (EEA)\n* Carbon Footprint Ltd.\n* Various airline and aircraft manufacturer reports.",

The KNOWLEDGE points out that higher altitudes are generally colder, and gas-powered cars tend to be slightly more fuel efficient in colder climates.\n2. The KNOWLEDGE explains that, in the case of gasoline engines, higher altitude theoretically leads to lower fuel consumption due to lower throttle frictions.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE mentions that, at higher altitudes, there is less air, which leads to the ECU providing less petrol, making acceleration less efficient.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE discusses aircraft-specific information, including the decrease in fuel consumption with increasing aircraft altitude, and the importance of high thermodynamic power for high-altitude, high-speed cruise in future turboprops.\n5. The KNOWLEDGE also touches on electric-powered aircraft, which do not experience power output losses at high altitude.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE provides mixed evidence regarding the STATEMENT. On one hand, it suggests that higher altitudes can lead to lower fuel consumption in gasoline engines, and that aircraft fuel consumption decreases with increasing altitude. On the other hand, it highlights the challenges of acceleration at higher altitudes due to less air, and the importance of high thermodynamic power for efficient high-altitude, high-speed cruise.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nFlying at higher altitudes and speeds can be more fuel-efficient, but only under certain conditions and with specific engine technologies.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Unverifiable]\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE provides some evidence supporting the STATEMENT, but also raises important caveats and exceptions. While higher altitudes can lead to lower fuel consumption in certain cases, the relationship between altitude, speed, and fuel efficiency is complex and depends on various factors, including engine type and technology. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to confirm or deny the STATEMENT.",

However, they do provide information on the aircraft's fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions per seat. The 25% reduction in CO2 emissions per seat is a relevant piece of information, but it does not directly translate to CO2 emissions per kilometer per passenger.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe statement remains the same: The Airbus A350-900 (long-haul) has estimated CO2 emissions per kilometer of around 50 g CO2/km per passenger.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Unverifiable]\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or deny the STATEMENT.

By adding \"fuel efficiency\", \"carbon footprint\", and \"environmental impact\" as alternative phrases, we increase the chances of finding relevant information on Airbus's official website, which might provide more detailed and accurate data on the A350-900's emissions per passenger kilometer.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"Airbus A350-900\" \"long-haul\" \"emissions per passenger kilometer\" (\"fuel efficiency\" OR \"carbon footprint\" OR \"environmental impact\") site:airbus.com\n```"

This query takes a different approach by using the `site:` operator to focus on government and educational websites, which are more likely to provide credible and in-depth information on CO2 emissions. By excluding \"route\" and \"weather\" from the search, we can discover other factors that affect CO2 emissions per kilometer by a plane, beyond the ones mentioned in the statement.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n(\"CO2 emissions per kilometer by plane\" factors -route -weather) site:gov OR site:edu\n```"
