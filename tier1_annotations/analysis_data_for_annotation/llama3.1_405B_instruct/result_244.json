    "prompt": "I want to plant a garden plant that blossoms in April. Any ideas?",
    "response": "April is a wonderful time for many beautiful flowers to bloom. Here are some garden plant ideas that typically blossom in April, depending on your location and climate:\n\n1. **Tulips** (Tulipa spp.): These classic spring bulbs come in a wide range of colors and are one of the most popular April-blooming flowers.\n2. **Daffodils** (Narcissus spp.): Another iconic spring bulb, daffodils are known for their bright yellow and white trumpet-shaped blooms.\n3. **Hyacinths** (Hyacinthus orientalis): These fragrant, bell-shaped flowers come in a variety of colors, including blue, pink, white, and yellow.\n4. **Crocuses** (Crocus spp.): These tiny, cup-shaped flowers are often one of the first signs of spring and come in a range of colors, including purple, yellow, and white.\n5. **Azaleas** (Rhododendron spp.): These flowering shrubs produce vibrant, funnel-shaped blooms in shades of pink, purple, and white.\n6. **Rhododendrons** (Rhododendron spp.): Similar to azaleas, rhododendrons produce showy, funnel-shaped flowers in a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white.\n7. **Pansies** (Viola x wittrockiana): These colorful, delicate flowers come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, yellow, and white.\n8. **Violets** (Viola spp.): These small, delicate flowers are often purple, but can also be found in shades of pink, yellow, and white.\n9. **Lilacs** (Syringa spp.): While they may not bloom until late April, lilacs are a classic spring flower with fragrant, purple blooms.\n10. **Forget-me-nots** (Myosotis spp.): These small, blue flowers are often found in lawns and meadows, but can also be cultivated in gardens.\n\nKeep in mind that the exact blooming time may vary depending on your location, climate, and specific weather conditions. Make sure to choose a plant that is suitable for your region and provides the right growing conditions. Happy gardening!",
