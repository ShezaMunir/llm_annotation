By excluding ChatGPT, we can explore other LLM-based translation systems and their performance in these areas. The use of `OR` operators allows us to capture a range of relevant terms, while maintaining a balance between specificity and breadth.\n\n**Rationale for changes:**\nIn Round 3, we observed that the results were still focused on document-level translation and evaluation. To better address the statement, we need to shift the focus to the quality of the translations themselves. By adding fluency, coherence, and naturalness to the query, we can retrieve information on how LLMs perform in terms of producing accurate and natural-sounding translations."
