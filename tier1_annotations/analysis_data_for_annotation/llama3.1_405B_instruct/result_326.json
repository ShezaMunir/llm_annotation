To improve, I'm rephrasing the query to focus on the relationship between dartboard layouts and specific game types. This query is more targeted and likely to retrieve information on how different dartboard layouts are designed for particular games, which can help verify the statement's accuracy.\n\n**Next Steps:** \nIn the next round, I'll analyze the results of this query and adjust my approach based on the information found. If the results are still insufficient, I may explore using specific game names (e.g., \"cricket\" or \"301\") in combination with \"dartboard layout\" to see if that yields more relevant results."
