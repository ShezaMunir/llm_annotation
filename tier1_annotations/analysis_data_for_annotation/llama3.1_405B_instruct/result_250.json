    "prompt": "Explain how bitcoin works like I am 10",
    "response": "Oh boy, are you going to love learning about Bitcoin!\n\nImagine you have a special kind of money that exists only on computers and phones. This money is called Bitcoin.\n\n**How is it made?**\nBitcoin is made by powerful computers solving very hard math problems. These computers are like super-fast calculators that work day and night to solve these problems. When a computer solves a problem, it gets a reward in the form of some brand new Bitcoins!\n\n**How is it stored?**\nBitcoins are stored in a special kind of computer program called a \"wallet\". Think of it like a virtual piggy bank where you can keep your Bitcoins safe.\n\n**How is it sent?**\nWhen you want to send Bitcoins to someone else, you use the internet to send a message to the whole world saying \"Hey, I want to send some Bitcoins to this person!\" This message is like a digital letter that says who you are, who you're sending the Bitcoins to, and how many Bitcoins you're sending.\n\n**How is it secure?**\nHere's the really cool part: all of these messages (or \"transactions\") are recorded in a public book called the \"blockchain\". The blockchain is like a super-long list of all the Bitcoin transactions that have ever happened. It's maintained by lots of computers all around the world, so it's very hard for someone to cheat or fake a transaction.\n\n**How do people trust it?**\nPeople trust Bitcoin because it's like a game where everyone follows the same rules. The rules are built into the computer code, so everyone knows how it works. And because the blockchain is public, everyone can see all the transactions that have happened, so it's very transparent.\n\n**What can you do with it?**\nYou can use Bitcoins to buy things online, like video games or music. Some people even use it to buy real-life things, like food or toys! You can also save your Bitcoins in your wallet and hope that they become more valuable over time.\n\nWow, you're now a Bitcoin expert! Do you have any questions about how it works?",

The KNOWLEDGE points out that Bitcoin mining is a global race to \"find\" a solution, and math problems change with every new block created, which implies that solving math problems is involved in the mining process.\n2. The KNOWLEDGE explains that the \"math problems\" are used to avoid double spending and are part of the \"proof of work\" mechanism, which requires miners to use computing resources.\n3.

While it's true that solving a \"math problem\" is involved in the mining process, the KNOWLEDGE suggests that the term \"math problem\" is misleading, and that miners don't actually solve complex math problems.
