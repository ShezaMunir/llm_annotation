The KNOWLEDGE points mention the Google Text-to-Speech API and its features, such as a wide range of languages, voices, and customizable options.\n2. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention the importance of complying with royalty or licensing requirements associated with the TTS voices used.\n3. There are multiple instances where users express uncertainty about using Google Text-to-Speech for commercial purposes, indicating that there may be licensing or agreement requirements that need to be considered.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE points also mention free credits and usage limits for new customers, but do not explicitly state that the service is free for commercial use.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE points do not provide direct evidence that Google Text-to-Speech is a free text-to-voice tool that allows commercial use. In fact, the emphasis on complying with licensing requirements and the uncertainty expressed by users suggest that there may be costs or agreements associated with commercial use.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT should be rephrased to better reflect the uncertainty surrounding commercial use: \"Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a text-to-voice tool that may allow commercial use, but licensing and agreement requirements need to be considered.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Unverifiable]",
