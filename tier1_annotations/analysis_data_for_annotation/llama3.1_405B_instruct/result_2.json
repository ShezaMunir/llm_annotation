    "response": "Here are five popular and highly recommended textbooks for an \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\" course for undergraduate students:\n\n1. **\"The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 3: Quantum Mechanics\" by Richard P. Feynman**: This classic textbook is a timeless introduction to quantum mechanics, written by one of the most iconic physicists of the 20th century. Feynman's approach is intuitive, visual, and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for undergraduates.\n2. **\"Quantum Mechanics\" by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz**: This textbook is a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics, written by two Soviet physicists who were renowned for their work in the field. The book covers the basics of quantum mechanics, including wave functions, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and perturbation theory.\n3. **\"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\" by David J. Griffiths**: This textbook is a popular choice for undergraduate courses, known for its clear and concise explanations, as well as its emphasis on problem-solving. Griffiths covers the standard topics in quantum mechanics, including wave functions, operators, and quantum systems.\n4. **\"Quantum Mechanics: An Introduction\" by Walter Greiner**: This textbook provides a thorough introduction to quantum mechanics, covering topics such as wave-particle duality, Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, and quantum field theory. Greiner's approach is pedagogical and easy to follow, making it suitable for undergraduates.\n5. **\"Modern Quantum Mechanics\" by Sakurai and Napolitano**: This textbook is a modern introduction to quantum mechanics, covering topics such as quantum computing, entanglement, and decoherence. The authors' approach is comprehensive and up-to-date, making it a great choice for undergraduates who want to learn about the latest developments in the field.\n\nAll of these textbooks are widely used and respected in the physics community, and can serve as a solid foundation for an \"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\" course.",
