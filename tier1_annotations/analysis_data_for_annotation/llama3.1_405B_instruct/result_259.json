    "prompt": "Provide some example kubernetes audit events for someone running \"kubectl exec\" commands",
    "response": "When you run `kubectl exec` commands, Kubernetes generates audit events that capture details about the command execution. These events are part of the Kubernetes auditing system, which logs all requests made to the Kubernetes API. The auditing system is configurable, allowing you to specify what events are logged and where they are stored.\n\nBelow are some example Kubernetes audit events related to running `kubectl exec` commands. These examples are simplified and formatted for readability. Actual audit events may contain more fields and details.\n\n### Example 1: Successful `kubectl exec` Command\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": \"Event\",\n  \"apiVersion\": \"audit.k8s.io/v1\",\n  \"level\": \"Request\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-04-01T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"auditID\": \"12345\",\n  \"stage\": \"RequestReceived\",\n  \"requestURI\": \"/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/my-pod/exec?command=ls&container=my-container&stdin=true&stdout=true&tty=true\",\n  \"verb\": \"create\",\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"your-username\",\n    \"groups\": [\"system:masters\"]\n  },\n  \"sourceIPs\": [\"192.168.1.100\"],\n  \"objectRef\": {\n    \"resource\": \"pods\",\n    \"namespace\": \"default\",\n    \"name\": \"my-pod\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"responseStatus\": {\n    \"metadata\": {},\n    \"status\": \"Success\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Failed `kubectl exec` Due to Permission\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": \"Event\",\n  \"apiVersion\": \"audit.k8s.io/v1\",\n  \"level\": \"Request\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-04-01T12:05:00Z\",\n  \"auditID\": \"67890\",\n  \"stage\": \"RequestReceived\",\n  \"requestURI\": \"/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/my-pod/exec?command=ls&container=my-container&stdin=true&stdout=true&tty=true\",\n  \"verb\": \"create\",\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"restricted-user\",\n    \"groups\": [\"system:authenticated\"]\n  },\n  \"sourceIPs\": [\"192.168.1.101\"],\n  \"objectRef\": {\n    \"resource\": \"pods\",\n    \"namespace\": \"default\",\n    \"name\": \"my-pod\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"responseStatus\": {\n    \"metadata\": {},\n    \"status\": \"Failure\",\n    \"reason\": \"Forbidden\",\n    \"code\": 403\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example 3: `kubectl exec` with Non-Existing Pod\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": \"Event\",\n  \"apiVersion\": \"audit.k8s.io/v1\",\n  \"level\": \"Request\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-04-01T12:10:00Z\",\n  \"auditID\": \"34567\",\n  \"stage\": \"RequestReceived\",\n  \"requestURI\": \"/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/non-existing-pod/exec?command=ls&container=my-container&stdin=true&stdout=true&tty=true\",\n  \"verb\": \"create\",\n  \"user\": {\n    \"username\": \"your-username\",\n    \"groups\": [\"system:masters\"]\n  },\n  \"sourceIPs\": [\"192.168.1.100\"],\n  \"objectRef\": {\n    \"resource\": \"pods\",\n    \"namespace\": \"default\",\n    \"name\": \"non-existing-pod\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"v1\"\n  },\n  \"responseStatus\": {\n    \"metadata\": {},\n    \"status\": \"Failure\",\n    \"reason\": \"NotFound\",\n    \"code\": 404\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese examples illustrate how Kubernetes audit events capture details about `kubectl exec` commands, including successful executions, permission failures, and attempts to access non-existing resources. The actual content of audit events can vary based on the Kubernetes cluster's configuration and the specific actions taken.",
