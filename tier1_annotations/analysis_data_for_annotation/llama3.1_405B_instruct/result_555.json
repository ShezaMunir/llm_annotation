The use of \"photorealism\" and \"realism\" aims to capture results that assess the generated images' similarity to real-world objects and faces. By including \"evaluation\", \"assessment\", and \"comparison\", we can retrieve studies or articles that critically examine the performance of StyleGAN in generating realistic images. The `-benchmark` operator helps to exclude results that solely focus on benchmarking, which we didn't find useful in the previous round.\n\n**Rationale for changes:**\nI've added \"object\" to the query to cover the second part of the statement, which mentions generating images of objects, not just faces. I've also removed the `site:arxiv.org` operator, as it didn't yield useful results in the previous round. The use of quotation marks around \"StyleGAN\" and \"StyleGAN2\" ensures that we retrieve results that specifically mention these models."
