    "prompt": "How to use discord package in Python3 ",
    "response": "To use the `discord.py` package in Python, you need to follow several steps, including installation, setting up a bot, and writing the code to interact with Discord's API. Below is a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Install the discord.py package\n\nFirst, you need to install the `discord.py` library. You can do this using `pip`.\n\n```sh\npip install discord.py\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Discord Bot\n\n1. **Go to the Discord Developer Portal**: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).\n2. **Create a New Application**: Click on the \"New Application\" button.\n3. **Create a Bot**: In your newly created application's settings, navigate to the \"Bot\" tab, and then click on \"Add Bot\". Confirm the action.\n\n### Step 3: Get Your Bot's Token\n\nIn the \"Bot\" tab, you will find your bot's token. This is like a password, so keep it safe and do not share it.\n\n### Step 4: Write the Code\n\nNow, write a simple bot using `discord.py`. Create a new Python file, for example `bot.py`, and add the following code:\n\n```python\nimport discord\nfrom discord.ext import commands\n\nintents = discord.Intents.default()\nintents.messages = True  # Enable the message intent\n\nbot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=\"!\", intents=intents) \n\n@bot.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user}')\n    \n@bot.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    if message.author == bot.user:\n        return\n    \n    if message.content == \"hello\":\n        await message.channel.send(\"Hello!\")\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with the token you got from the Discord Developer Portal\nbot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')\n```\n\n### Step 5: Run Your Bot\n\nRun the Python script:\n\n```sh\npython bot.py\n```\n\n### Step 6: Invite Your Bot to Your Server\n\n1. **Go to the OAuth2 tab**: In your application's settings on the Discord Developer Portal, go to the \"OAuth2\" tab.\n2. **Generate an OAuth2 URL**: In the OAuth2 section, go to \"OAuth2 URL Generator\" and select the \"bot\" scope. Under \"Bot Permissions\", select the permissions your bot will need, like \"Send Messages\".\n3. **Copy and Paste the URL**: Copy the generated URL and paste it into a web browser. This will allow you to invite the bot to your server.\n\n### Example of Inviting URL:\n\n```plaintext\nhttps://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=3072\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual client ID. This will guide you to invite the bot to your server with the appropriate permissions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis basic example sets up a bot that logs in and responds with \"Hello!\" whenever a user types \"hello\" in any channel the bot has access to. From here, you can expand functionality using the discord.py library's extensive features.\n\nFor more functionalities and detailed documentation, refer to [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).",

The points mention checking if a message starts with '$hello' or 'hello', and responding with a greeting message.\n3. There are examples of defining a '!hello' command, checking if a message is equal to 'hello', and sending a reply with 'Hello!' or 'Hello World!'.\n4.

The evidence supporting this includes:\n\n* The code snippets show that the bot checks if a message starts with 'hello' or '$hello' and responds with a greeting message.\n* The examples of defining a '!hello' command and checking if a message is equal to 'hello' further support the idea that the bot responds to 'hello' messages.\n* Although the KNOWLEDGE points don't explicitly state that the bot responds to 'hello' in any channel, the examples suggest that the bot can respond to messages in various channels.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe STATEMENT can be restated as: \"This bot setup using discord.py responds with 'Hello!' whenever a user types 'hello' in any channel the bot has access to.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
