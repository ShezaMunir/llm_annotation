    "response": "In Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, when you use the spell *Animate Objects*, the objects you animate are considered \"creatures\" for the duration of the spell, but they don't fall into any of the standard creature types like beasts, constructs, or undead.\n\nInstead, they retain their categorization as objects but are treated as creatures for the purpose of interacting with spells and effects. This means they can be affected by spells and abilities that target creatures, but they are not assigned a specific creature type. They do not, for instance, become constructs or any other specific type.\n\nHere's the relevant description from the spell *Animate Objects*:\n\n*\"Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can\u2019t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\"*\n\nThis classification impacts how the animated objects interact with different game mechanics. For example:\n\n- The spell *Polymorph* won't work on animated objects since it only targets beasts.\n- Spells like *Hold Person*, which specifically target humanoids, also won't work on them.\n- General spells that affect creatures, like *Fireball*, will affect the animated objects as they do other creatures.\n\nSo, while they are treated as creatures for interaction purposes, they do not gain a specific creature type and retain some characteristics of objects (for instance, they cannot drink potions or perform complex actions that would require more cognitive function than they possess).",
