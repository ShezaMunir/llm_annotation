The KNOWLEDGE also mentions the integration of Ei Compendex with other Elsevier products, such as Scopus, and its indexing capabilities.\n3. The KNOWLEDGE points out that Ei Compendex provides citations to global engineering literature, with over 20 million records, and is set up in institutions and university computer networks.\n4. The KNOWLEDGE also mentions the benefits of using Ei Compendex, including high visibility to a global audience.\n\n**Evaluate Evidence:**\n\nThe KNOWLEDGE strongly implies and directly supports the STATEMENT. The evidence suggests that the integration of Ei Compendex with Elsevier's academic journals, books, and research tools has enhanced the accessibility and visibility of engineering research. Specifically, the KNOWLEDGE points out that Ei Compendex provides comprehensive coverage of scientific literature, including engineering research, and offers high visibility to a global audience.\n\n**Restate the STATEMENT:**\n\nThe integration of Ei Compendex's comprehensive indexing with Elsevier's academic journals, books, and research tools has increased the accessibility and visibility of engineering research to a global audience.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n[Supported]",
