    "prompt": "talking about the project ITER for a thermonuclear reactor, tell me which other similar projects exists and their status",
    "response": "Several other projects around the world are also focused on developing thermonuclear reactors or advancing fusion energy research. Here are a few prominent ones, along with their statuses:\n\n1. **National Ignition Facility (NIF) - USA:**\n   - **Location:** Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California\n   - **Status:** Operational\n   - The NIF aims to achieve ignition through inertial confinement fusion (ICF) by using powerful lasers to compress a small fuel pellet to extreme pressures and temperatures.\n\n2. **Joint European Torus (JET) - UK:**\n   - **Location:** Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Oxfordshire, England\n   - **Status:** Operational\n   - JET is the largest and most powerful operational tokamak. It focuses on plasma physics research and testing materials and configurations for ITER and future reactors.\n\n3. **China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) - China:**\n   - **Location:** Under planning, with contributions from various Chinese research institutions.\n   - **Status:** Design and planning phases\n   - CFETR aims to bridge the gap between ITER and a future demonstration power plant (DEMO), focusing on achieving continuous and stable operation.\n\n4. **Korean Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) - South Korea:**\n   - **Location:** National Fusion Research Institute, Daejeon\n   - **Status:** Operational\n   - KSTAR is a superconducting tokamak similar to ITER. It has achieved notable milestones in sustaining plasma for extended periods, essential for future fusion power plants.\n\n5. **SPARC - USA:**\n   - **Location:** MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Commonwealth Fusion Systems.\n   - **Status:** Under development\n   - SPARC is a compact, high-field tokamak aiming to demonstrate net energy gain from fusion. Initial construction has started with goals to achieve significant milestones by the mid-2020s.\n\n6. **Wendelstein 7-X - Germany:**\n   - **Location:** Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, Greifswald\n   - **Status:** Operational\n   - Wendelstein 7-X is the world\u2019s largest stellarator, a device similar to a tokamak but with a different magnetic confinement design. It aims to explore the potential of stellarators for steady-state operations.\n\n7. **DEMO - International:**\n   - **Location:** Various, with conceptual design studies led by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).\n   - **Status:** Conceptual Design Phase\n   - DEMO is a proposed next-step fusion power plant following ITER. It aims to demonstrate the production of electricity from fusion energy on a commercial scale.\n\n8. **Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) - UK:**\n   - **Location:** A site selection process is ongoing in the UK.\n   - **Status:** Conceptual Design and Planning Phases\n   - STEP is a UK project aiming to build a prototype fusion energy plant using a spherical tokamak design, targeting net energy gain and electricity production by 2040.\n\nThese projects collectively represent a global effort to make fusion energy a viable and sustainable power source. While all are at different stages of development, they contribute valuable knowledge, technological advances, and collaborative progress towards the common goal of practical fusion energy.",
