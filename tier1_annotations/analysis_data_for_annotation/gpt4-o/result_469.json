    "prompt": "How to solve a quadratic equation?",
    "response": "Solving a quadratic equation \u2014 an equation in the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) \u2014 can be done through several methods. Here are the most common ones:\n\n### 1. Factoring\nFactoring is suitable when the quadratic expression can be expressed as a product of two binomials.\n#### Steps:\n1. Express the quadratic equation in standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n2. Find two numbers that multiply to \\( ac \\) and add up to \\( b \\).\n3. Rewrite the quadratic expression using these numbers to split the middle term.\n4. Factor by grouping.\n5. Solve for the variable \\( x \\) by setting each factor equal to zero.\n\n**Example:**\nSolve \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \\).\n\n1. \\( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \\).\n2. The numbers 2 and 3 multiply to 6 and add up to 5.\n3. Rewrite: \\( x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6 = 0 \\).\n4. Factor by grouping: \\( x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = 0 \\).\n5. Simplify: \\( (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0 \\).\n6. Solve: \\( x + 3 = 0 \\rightarrow x = -3 \\) and \\( x + 2 = 0 \\rightarrow x = -2 \\).\n\n### 2. Using the Quadratic Formula\nThe quadratic formula can solve any quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Identify coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the equation.\n2. Substitute these values into the formula.\n3. Calculate the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n4. Compute the solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\n**Example:**\nSolve \\( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \\).\n\n1. \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = -4 \\), \\( c = -6 \\).\n2. Substitute: \\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-6)}}{2 \\cdot 2} \\).\n3. Simplify: \\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 48}}{4} \\).\n4. Calculate the discriminant: \\( \\Delta = 64 \\).\n5. Compute the solutions: \\( x = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{4} \\).\n6. Solutions: \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n### 3. Completing the Square\nThis method involves rearranging the equation to make a perfect square trinomial on one side.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Divide all terms by \\( a \\) (if \\( a \\neq 1 \\)).\n2. Move the constant term to the other side of the equation.\n3. Add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\( x \\).\n4. Write the left-hand side as a perfect square.\n5. Solve the resulting equation by taking the square root of both sides.\n6. Simplify and solve for \\( x \\).\n\n**Example:**\nSolve \\( x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0 \\).\n\n1. \\( x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0 \\).\n2. Move constant: \\( x^2 + 6x = -5 \\).\n3. Add and subtract \\( (6/2)^2 = 9 \\): \\( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 4 \\).\n4. Rewrite: \\( (x + 3)^2 = 4 \\).\n5. Solve: \\( x + 3 = \\pm 2 \\).\n6. Solutions: \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = -5 \\).\n\n### 4. Graphing\nGraphing the quadratic equation \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) and finding the points where the graph intersects the x-axis also provides the solutions.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Create the graph of the quadratic equation.\n2. Identify the x-intercepts.\n\nWhile graphing can be useful for visualization and approximation, it is not always the most precise method for finding exact solutions.\n\nThese methods allow you to solve any quadratic equation effectively.

To improve upon this, we'll add specific keywords to target scenarios where the methods might not be effective. By incorporating phrases like \"certain types\", \"special cases\", and \"exceptional scenarios\", we're likely to uncover information about the limitations and potential pitfalls of each method, which will help verify the accuracy of the STATEMENT.\n\n**Formatted Query:**\n```\n\"quadratic equation solving methods limitations\" AND (\"certain types\" OR \"special cases\" OR \"exceptional scenarios\")\n```\nThis query aims to retrieve information about the limitations and potential exceptions of the four methods mentioned in the STATEMENT, which will help us better understand their effectiveness in solving quadratic equations."
