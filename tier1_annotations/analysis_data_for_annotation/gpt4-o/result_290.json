    "prompt": "Where does the Poetry Python package manager store the Python packages?",
    "response": "Poetry, a popular dependency manager and packaging tool for Python, manages dependencies by creating a virtual environment for your project. The Python packages are installed within this virtual environment.\n\nBy default, the location where Poetry stores the virtual environment depends on the Poetry configuration. The virtual environments can be managed in one of three ways:\n\n1. **In the project's directory**: If you have configured Poetry to create virtual environments in the project's directory, it will store the virtual environments within a `.<project-name>-py<python-version>` folder inside your project's root directory.\n\n2. **In a centralized cache directory**: If you haven't configured a custom location for virtual environments, Poetry uses a global cache directory by default. On most systems, this directory is located at:\n   - **Linux:** `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs`\n   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs`\n   - **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\pypoetry\\Cache\\virtualenvs`\n\n3. **Custom location**: You can also customize the location where Poetry stores virtual environments by setting the `virtualenvs.path` configuration:\n   ```shell\n   poetry config virtualenvs.path /path/to/your/custom/location\n   ```\n\nTo check the current configuration, you can use the command:\n```shell\npoetry config --list\n```\n\nTo see where Poetry has created the virtual environment for your project, you can use:\n```shell\npoetry env info\n```\n\nThis command will provide details about the virtual environment, including its location.",
