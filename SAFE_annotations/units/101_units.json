    "prompt": "You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. \nYou receive several sentences, describing the same image you are observing. In addition, locations of some specific interested objects within the image are given, along with detailed coordinates. These coordinates are in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the left top x, left top y, right bottom x, and right bottom y.\nUsing the provided caption and bounding box information, analyse the scene in image. Give descrptions about these specific interested objects in image in a step by step manner. \nGive descriptions about the visual content of each interested objects in this step by step manner as if you are seeing the image:\n(1) step 1, describe the object itself. Give diverse and detailed descriptions about the object as much as possible. Descriptions can be object types, object functions, object postures, object counts, object locations in the sence, object relative positions in image, object actions, etc. Descriptions should be a series of phrases, not whole sentence.\n(2) step 2, describe the object by involving other objects in image. Give diverse and detailed descriptions about the paired objects as much as possible. Descriptions can be the relative positions between objects, the interaction between objects in the image, the relationship between objects, etc. Descriptions should be a series of phrases, not whole sentence.\nInstead of directly mentioning the bounding box coordinates in description, utilize this data to analyse the objects' relative positions in the scene.\nAgain, only give descriptions about the specific interested objects, do not center around other objects.\nI will give you a few examples before letting you assist. Learn from these examples and then I will give you the real task.",
