Here's a poem about the NAME_1:\nOh, NAME_1, you silvery sphere above,\nSo tranquil in your gentle love,\nYou wax and wane with graceful ease,\nYour beauty brings us to our knees.\n\nYour face is but a glowing arc,\nA beacon in the starry dark,\nAnd as you rise into the sky,\nYou light our way as we pass by.\n\nOh, how we marvel at your glow,\nAnd watch you as you ebb and flow,\nYour phases guide us through the night,\nAnd fill our dreams with your sweet light.\n\nYou are a symbol of the divine,\nA heavenly body that we enshrine,\nA wonder of the universe,\nA source of hope and endless verse.\n\nSo here's to you, dear NAME_1 above,\nA shining symbol of our love,\nMay you forever light our way,\nAnd guide us through both night and day.",
