    "prompt": "Summarize it in one sentence: First the converter tries to connect to a postgres database. -> Method not secure atm. If no connection could be established the program ends. The files in the _IN directory are read one by one. For each file there should be a table in the database. If there is none it creates one. Then it reads the .xml file, replaces unwanted html tags in the content with xml conform characters  and parses the created string with an xml parser. Then it runs through the xml nodes and looks for attached information. If the node has text content or attributes, the table should have a column for the data. The script checks if there is one and if not it creates one. Then the script adds the current data for the column and all parents (so a whole row up to the current column) in the table.",
