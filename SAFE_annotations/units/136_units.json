You can modify this code to detect the edges of the tank and the barrel in the game screen and extract the necessary parameters. Can you modify the code asper the below provided instructions?",
    "response": "Yes, I can modify the code as per the instructions. First, I need to detect the edges of the tank and the barrel in the game screen. To do this, I need to apply an edge detection algorithm to the grayscale image. I can use the Canny edge detection algorithm with a range of 50 and 150 for the lower and upper thresholds, respectively. After that, I need to find contours in the edge image. To do this, I can use the contour and hierarchy functions of the OpenCV library. After that, I need to loop over all contours and draw them on the original image. Finally, I need to display the image with the contours drawn. Can you guide me with the code for this?",
