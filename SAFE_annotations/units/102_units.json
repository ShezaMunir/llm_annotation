For overall mortality, with 74,193 participants and 61 deaths\n(mRNA:31; placebo:30), the relative risk (RR) for the two mRNA vaccines compared with placebo\nwas 1.03 (95% CI=0.63-1.71). In the adenovirus-vector vaccines there were 122,164 participants\nand 46 deaths (vaccine:16; controls:30). The RR for adenovirus-vector vaccines versus\nplacebo/control vaccine was 0.37 (0.19-0.70). The adenovirus-vector vaccines were associated\nwith protection against COVID-19 deaths (RR=0.11 (0.02-0.87)) and non-accident, non-COVID-19\ndeaths (RR=0.38 (0.17-0.88)). The two types of vaccines differed significantly with respect to\nimpact on overall mortality (p=0.030) as well as non-accident, non-COVID-19 deaths (p=0.046).\nThe placebo controlled RCTs of COVID-19 vaccines were halted rapidly due to clear effects on\nCOVID-19 infections. However, the data presented here argue for performing RCTs of mRNA and\nadeno-vectored vaccines head-to-head comparing long-term effects on overall mortality.\n\nDISCUSSION\nBased on the RCTs with the longest possible follow-up, mRNA vaccines had no effect on overall\nmortality despite protecting against fatal COVID-19. On the other hand, the adenovirus-vector\nvaccines were associated with lower overall mortality and lower non-accident, non-COVID-19\nmortality. The pattern of effects was internally consistent in the RCTs of mRNA and adenovirusvector vaccines, respectively.\nAn intrinsic limitation for the estimation of overall mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic is\nthe nature of the cohorts studied. Most of the volunteers participating in the trials were adult\nindividuals in general good health, resulting in low COVID-19 and overall mortality. In a real-life\nsituation in which the COVID-19 vaccines are administered to highly vulnerable populations with\nhigh COVID-19-dependent mortality, significant gains in overall mortality are expected, also for\nmRNA vaccines. However, the intriguin",
    "response": "The most important takeaway from the study is that the adenovirus-vector vaccines are associated with lower overall mortality and lower non-accident, non-COVID-19 mortality. This contrasts with the mRNA vaccines which had no effect on overall mortality despite protecting against fatal COVID-19. The results suggest that further studies of both types of vaccines should compare long-term effects on overall mortality. However, it is worth noting that the study involved only one cohort of participants, which may not accurately represent the population in a real-life scenario.",
