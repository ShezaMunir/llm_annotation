    "prompt": "Solve this equation for x: x*x + 5 = 7",
    "response": "To solve this equation for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. One way to do this is by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx*x + 5 = 7\nx*x = 7 - 5\nx*x = 2\n\nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by x:\n\nx*x = 2\nx = 2\n\nSo the solution to the equation x*x + 5 = 7 is x = 2.",
