To do this question?\n\nNAME_1: You got to know the\n\nNAME_1: okay. So when I say efficient here you could go through all of the derivatives and plug in 0,\n\nNAME_1: which works it works. But when you think about doing that, how would you take the how to? You can find the first derivative which rule would you have to use\n\nNAME_1: product group?\n\nNAME_1: Which is not it, which is doable, but it starts to get kind of messy, so you could force it to work\n\nNAME_1: right by taking the derivatives. Okay, so I guess, when I say the most efficient way. That's kind of a subjective statement, right? So what's efficient to me may not necessarily be efficient to you, and so I don't want to. I don't want to down or look down on just taking the rivers.\n\nNAME_1: but the fact that we have to go out to the fourth degree properly means we have to take at least 4 derivatives, and if I have product rule here, that product was going to multiply as we go down the derivative row.\n\nNAME_1: So what I really want you to hold on to\n\nNAME_1: is the Mccluren expansion. Now have do we have this memorized? Everybody said, Yes, what is the\n\nokay?\n\nIt was? Yeah.\n\nNAME_1: So it's so forth. Okay, do we know\n\nNAME_1: the expansion for the sign of X.\n\nNAME_1: So it's an E. It's an odd function. So I need to have odd exponents folk around here, 5 factorial minus X to the seventh.\n\nNAME_1: all of a sudden factorial. So what is it that we're gonna have to do? Now? Okay.\n\nNAME_1: check this out. This is actually that far. This is a calculus kind of question here.\n\nNAME_1: Now I do recognize this is going to infinity, and this is going to infinity as well. So we can, so we can't multiply all of these terms out. We need to multiply enough of them out\n\nNAME_1: so that we get to the fourth degree.\n\nNAME_1: I kind of see what's going on, so what you're going to do is look at products and say, do I need to multiply that out? Is that going to be bigger than X to the fourth power? If it is, I can ignore that product and maybe focus on these products, right? So we're trying to be as efficient as we can. And so what I would want you to at least write down\n\nNAME_1: is\n\nNAME_1: a portion of this. So this is going to be one plus x\n\nplus x 2\n\nNAME_1: over 2,\n\nall right, plus x to the third\n\nNAME_1: over 3 factorial or 6, plus that that that that that that close to\n\nNAME_1: minus X to the third over 3 factorial plus X to the fifth\n\nNAME_1: over 5 factory plus stuff like that. Some",

So now what we need to do is look at each of these chunks and say, do we need to multiply this out? And if we do, how many times",
