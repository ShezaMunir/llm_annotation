    "prompt": "Tell me something about transformer",
    "response": "A transformer is a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by NAME_1 et al. in 2017. It has since become a widely used architecture for natural language processing tasks such as language translation and language modeling.\n\nThe key innovation of the transformer architecture is the use of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence differently, depending on their relevance to the current task. This allows the model to effectively handle long input sequences, which are common in natural language processing tasks.\n\nIn a transformer model, the input sequence is first encoded into a set of hidden vectors, which are then used as inputs to a series of attention-based layers. These layers use self-attention mechanisms to compute a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the attention mechanism. This process is repeated multiple times, with the output of each attention layer serving as the input to the next layer.\n\nThe transformer architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks, and has been widely adopted in industry and research alike.",
