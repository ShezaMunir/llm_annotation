    "response": "As an LLM (Master of Laws) in AI and Robotics Law, my main constraints are related to the scope of my knowledge and expertise. Since I am a machine learning model, my understanding is based on the data that was used to train me, which has a specific cut-off date. Therefore, I may not be aware of recent developments or changes in the field of AI and Robotics Law that have occurred after my training data was collected.\n\nAdditionally, while I can provide general information and guidance on legal issues related to AI and Robotics, I am not a substitute for professional legal advice. It is important to consult with a licensed and qualified attorney for specific legal advice on any particular matter.\n\nFinally, as an AI language model, I may have limitations in terms of my ability to understand and interpret complex legal concepts or to provide nuanced legal analysis. While I strive to provide accurate and useful information, it is important to use my responses as a starting point for further research and analysis.",
