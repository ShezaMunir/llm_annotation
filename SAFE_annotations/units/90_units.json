    "response": "To NAME_1 through files in a directory using Python, you can use the `os` and `os.path` modules along with the `glob` method. Here's an example code:\n```python\nimport os\nimport glob\n\n# Set the directory path to search for files\ndir_path = '/path/to/directory'\n\n# Use glob.glob() to get a list of all files in the directory\nfile_paths = glob.glob(dir_path + '/*.txt')\n\n# NAME_1 through each file in the list\nfor file_path in file_paths:\n    print(file_path)\n```\nIn this example, we first set the `dir_path` variable to the path of the directory we want to search for files. Then, we use the `glob.glob()` method to get a list of all files with the `.txt` extension in the directory. Finally, we NAME_1 through each file in the list using a `for` NAME_1 and print the file path to the console.\n\nNote that the `glob` method can also be used to search for files with other file extensions, or to search for files recursively in subdirectories.",
