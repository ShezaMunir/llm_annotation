    "response": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain Fibonacci numbers!\n\nFibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. The series begins like this:\n\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nEach number in the series is the sum of the two preceding numbers, so for example, 3 is the sum of 1 and 2, 5 is the sum of 2 and 3, and 8 is the sum of 5 and 3.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is named after the Italian mathematician NAME_1, who first introduced it in the 13th century. It has many interesting properties and is found in many natural phenomena, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the branching of trees, the flowering of artichokes, and the structure of pineapples.\n\nOne of the most well-known properties of Fibonacci numbers is that the ratio of any two adjacent numbers in the sequence approaches the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618. This means that as you move further along the sequence, the ratio of the numbers gets closer and closer to 1.618.\n\nFibonacci numbers also have many practical applications, such as in computer programming, finance, and biology. For example, they can be used to model population growth, the spread of disease, and the behavior of complex systems.\n\nI hope this helps! Do you have any specific questions about Fibonacci numbers that I can help with?",
