However, the collapse of the empire was a gradual process that spanned several centuries. The empire began to decline in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE due to a combination of factors such as economic troubles, political instability, and invasions by barbarian tribes. By the 5th century CE, the empire had been divided into two parts, the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire, and both were facing significant challenges. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, while the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, survived for another thousand years.",
