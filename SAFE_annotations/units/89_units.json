    "prompt": "Rewrite this but make it more casual and interesting, keep the exact meaning: There is no real reason to pay for GPT4 anymore!\n\nTo be honest, I was very excited when I started using GPT4. It was clearly more powerful than GPT3.5, so I also purchased a Plus membership so I could use GPT4. \n\nLately, GPT4 has become so dull and unhelpful to me that I don't really notice that much difference between 3.5 and 4 anymore, sometimes even no difference at all.\n\nI use it mainly to help me write stuff, and I've noticed fluctuations in output quality for some time now. However, especially recently, 70% of the time the output is so vague and dull that it makes me wonder why I'm still paying for this.\n\nSome time ago, with detailed guidelines, I could adjust the writing style of GPT4 to my imagination. But no matter how hard I currently try to create decent prompts, the output quality remains a wall of boring, generic text that matches what I get from GPT3 Playground. It doesn't matter what I write into my prompt, the writing style remains extremely generic and lacking in content with 90% filler content and pointless gibberish. \n\n- The texts used to be full of detailed information that were 99% accurate. I could ask GPT4 to write about a topic and it gave really helpful responses with lots of information and ideas that I would never have come up with myself. Now it's just \"yeah okay ChatGPT, it's pretty obvious\" output - just the most obvious information possible.\n\n- My prompts are only roughly taken into account. If I specify a writing style, I either get a text with a writing style that \" somewhat \" goes in that direction, but is still completely generic, like it was with 3.5. Or, it is completely ignored and I always get the same wall of boring text, no matter what I write in my prompt. Even the simplest statements like \"write the text more casual than formal\" are not being understood.\n\n- Texts currently always follow the exact same pattern. A generic intro which is always the same for this particular topic > a wall of text where everybody realizes after 10 seconds that this is AI content > a silly conclusion that makes absolutely no sense. \n\nI feel like GPT4 is no longer trying to understand my prompts and spit out anything good.\n\nI am canceling my GTP4 membership because I believe I am using a downgraded and incompetent version of GPT4.\n\nI know this is frequently mentioned in this subreddit, but I believe it is critical because ChatGPT will continue to worsen. It is currently only useful for silly memes and other nonsense.",
