    "prompt": "reviewing this presentation of symptoms and experiences what, statistically is the likely diagnosis: patient climbing steep stair hiking trail. patient completed hike, steps normally on left leg and feels gentle snapping sensation without pain or bruising. later experiences knee discomfort (no snapping or catching) and some warm sensations along tendons down the front and side of the leg - with slight numbness. symptoms are intermittent. patient can climb stairs and walk normally. legs can be fully extended and bent without pain or issue. patient develops discomfort after walking for 10-15 minutes or swimming for 20 minutes (standard crawl swim). discomfort includes a warm or burning sensation in the calves and outer tendon of leg below the knee. also pain in the knee while walking which often resolves by turning the foot inward. taking a break from high activity resolves most discomfort and pain, with more activity discomfort returns. weight bearing is fine. stability is fine. full bend and extension are still fine.",
    "response": "Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis as I am not able to physically examine the patient. However, some possibilities include:\n\n1. Patellofemoral pain syndrome: This is a common condition characterized by pain in the front of the knee, particularly when going up and down stairs or hills. It is often caused by overuse or incorrect tracking of the patella (kneecap).\n2. Tendinopathy: Inflammation or degeneration of a tendon can cause pain and warm sensations along the affected tendon. This could be caused by overuse or poor biomechanics.\n3. Tibial stress syndrome: This is a condition that causes shin pain, often due to repetitive stress or overuse. It can cause a burning sensation in the calves and outer tendon of the leg.\n4. Chondromalacia patella: This is a condition in which the cartilage on the underside of the patella becomes softened and damaged, causing pain and clicking or snapping sensations.\n\nIt is important to note that these are only possible diagnoses based on the information provided, and a thorough examination by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.",
