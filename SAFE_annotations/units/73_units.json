    "prompt": "NAME_1 is a male college student who wants to increase their overall fitness and strength. They have access to a gym but is unsure of how to create an effective workout plan. NAME_1 is 25 years old, 6 feet tall, and 235 pounds, and has some experience weightlifting. Some of his most recent lifts will follow this in this format (weight/sets/reps). \nSquat 190/4/8, dumbbell goblet squat 65/4/11, leg extension 120/4/11\n\nBarbell Shoulder Press 95/4/9, Lateral raise 15/4/14, \n\nBench Press 170/4/10, Incline dumbbell press 60/4/10, Rope Extension 32.5/4/12\n\nKeep in mind that these are not all of Jays exercises, and only a few so that you have a baseline for his strength. Develop an ideal training plan for NAME_1 to lose weight, while maintaining or even gaining a little bit of muscle mass. NAME_1 likes to limit his workouts to about 30-40 minutes. NAME_1 also has a low VO2 NAME_2 and would like to raise it. NAME_1 doesn\u2019t have good cardio, or core strength so ensure that you\u2019re able to also work on those as well. NAME_1 doesn\u2019t know any good core(abs) workouts, and he hates running so most of his cardio comes from walking, and hiking after the gym. \n\nEnsure that the training plan you build is SPECIFIC, and attainable for NAME_1. Include recommended weights for the exercises. Also ensure that the workout is split up by workout target i.e chest, shoulders, legs, etc. Abs, and vo2 NAME_2 training can be incorporated into every workout however though, maybe at the end or as a cool down.",
