    "prompt": "What are the planets in the solar system?",
    "response": "The planets in the solar system are the five large celestial bodies that make up the solar system: the Sun, the Earth, the NAME_1, Mars, and Mercury. The Sun is the center of the solar system and is made up of five planets, while the Earth is the largest of the planets and is home to life as we know it. The other planets are all small and are not capable of supporting life as we know it. The planets are further spread out from the Sun than the NAME_1 is from the Earth, and they are all located in a specific orbit around the Sun.",
