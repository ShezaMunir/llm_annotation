    "response": "Verse 1: \"So when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had been told that NAME_2 was making and baptizing more disciples than NAME_1\"\n\nIn this verse, we see that the Pharisees had become aware of NAME_2' increasing popularity, as more people were being baptized by NAME_2' disciples than by NAME_3. This was likely a source of concern for the Pharisees, as they saw NAME_2 as a threat to their religious authority.\n\nVerse 2: \"although NAME_2 Himself was not baptizing, but His disciples were\"\n\nThis verse clarifies that while NAME_2 was not physically baptizing people, He was still closely involved in the ministry of His disciples, who were baptizing on His behalf. This further highlights the growing division between NAME_2 and the Pharisees, as the Pharisees believed that baptizing was a task that should only be performed by the NAME_4.",
