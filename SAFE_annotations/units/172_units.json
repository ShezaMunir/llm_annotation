This applies to gauge transmitters only. For absolute  transmitters this has no affect, due to the refere nce to absolute vacuum and not atmospheric pres- sure. This is also the reason why no breather tube is necessary.

Please observe that testing and recalibrat ion of transmitters mounted in hazardous  areas shall be carried out by Ex qualified personnel. An internally mounted transducer can NAME_1 so be recalibrated by using vacuum. 1.Check that the tank is empty. 2.Check that the range select switch on the amplifier is correctly set. 3.Set the calibrator to vacuum mode. 4.Connect the hose from the calibrator to the breather tube from the transducer cable. 5.In conditions of no pressure the output signal should be adjusted to 4.00 mA on the zero poten- tiometer. 6.Increase the vacuum equal to the maximum height of the fluid (water gaug e) and adjust the out- put signal to 20.00 mA on the span potentiometer. 7.Remove the vacuum and check the zero point. 8.Check the linearity at 0-25-50-75 an d 100% of the measuring range.\n\nabsolute vacuum. An atmospheric pre ssure sensor is used to compen- sate for the atmospheric pressure. The absolute transducer is espe- cially suitable for open deck app lications, where the amplifier box may  be exposed to flooding. G Gauge Transducer The gauge transducer is fitted with a breather pipe at the back of the  diaphragm to compensate for the at mospheric pressure. The breather  pipe is connected to a vent plug in  the amplifier box. The gauge trans- ducer is suitable for most applications.",
    "response": "1. Answer: The breather tube is necessary for gauge transmitters only, and it should be directed to an area with atmospheric pressure equal to the pressure inside the tank.\n2. Support in %: 100% - The context provides clear information about the use of the breather tube for gauge transmitters and its importance in compensating for atmospheric pressure.\n3. Confidence in %: 90% - The answer is based on the information provided in the context, and it accurately addresses the question. However, there is a small possibility that additional information could be required to fully answer the question.",
